# v0.2 Milestone Audit: Game-Specific League Formats

## Executive Summary

**Milestone v0.2 is at 0% execution.** No code has been written, no phases have been completed, and all 40 requirements remain pending. Only Phase 1 has detailed plans (4 plans in 3 waves). Phases 2-7 have not been planned yet.

This audit was triggered before execution began — the milestone is in a **planning-complete-for-Phase-1** state.

## Requirements Coverage

| Category | Requirements | Satisfied | Partial | Unsatisfied |
|----------|-------------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| League Format System (FMT) | 4 | 0 | 0 | 4 |
| Match Recording (MTH) | 7 | 0 | 0 | 7 |
| Standings & Scoring (STD) | 7 | 0 | 0 | 7 |
| OW Path to Glory (OWP) | 7 | 0 | 0 | 7 |
| 40k Crusade (CRU) | 8 | 0 | 0 | 8 |
| AoS Path to Glory (APG) | 7 | 0 | 0 | 7 |
| **Total** | **40** | **0** | **0** | **40** |

**Score: 0/40 requirements satisfied**

## Phase Status

| Phase | Plans | Executed | VERIFICATION.md | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| 1. Format System Foundation | 4 plans ready | 0/4 | Missing | Planned, not executed |
| 2. Game-Specific Match Recording | Not planned | 0/? | Missing | Not started |
| 3. Game-Specific Standings & Scoring | Not planned | 0/? | Missing | Not started |
| 4. OW Path to Glory Progression | Not planned | 0/? | Missing | Not started |
| 5. 40k Crusade Progression | Not planned | 0/? | Missing | Not started |
| 6. AoS Path to Glory Progression | Not planned | 0/? | Missing | Not started |
| 7. Release & Deploy | Not planned | 0/? | Missing | Not started |

**Score: 0/7 phases completed**

## Integration Analysis

### Phase 1 Internal Wiring: EXCELLENT

Phase 1's 4 plans are well-architected with complete export/import chains:

- **Format registry** (01-01) → consumed by create.vue (01-02), LeagueCard/DashboardView/LeagueSetupView (01-04), PATCH endpoint (01-04)
- **DB schema change** (01-01) → consumed by create API (01-02), migration script (01-03), all GET/PATCH endpoints (01-04)
- **League creation flow**: complete chain from UI → store → API → DB → response → cache → display
- **Format immutability flow**: complete client + server enforcement planned
- **Cache invalidation**: explicitly addressed in plans (RESEARCH.md pitfall #5)

### Cross-Phase Integration Gaps

| Gap | From | To | Risk | Description |
|-----|------|----|------|-------------|
| Match form routing | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | HIGH | No spec for how match forms consume `league.format` to switch fields |
| Standings calculator | Phase 1 | Phase 3 | MEDIUM-HIGH | `useStandings.js` has no format awareness, needs refactor |
| Progression UI gating | Phase 1 | Phases 4/5/6 | MEDIUM | No routing plan for conditionally showing progression features |
| Deploy sequence | Phase 1 | Phase 7 | MEDIUM | Migration script + schema migration timing undefined |
| Admin endpoint | Phase 1 | — | LOW | `/api/admin/leagues.get.ts` not mentioned in Plan 01-04 |

### E2E Flow Status

| Flow | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Create league with format | Planned, not built | Phase 1 plans cover full chain |
| Display format badge | Planned, not built | Phase 1 Plan 01-04 covers |
| Change format before match | Planned, not built | Client + server enforcement planned |
| Record game-specific match | Not planned | Depends on Phase 2 |
| View format-specific standings | Not planned | Depends on Phase 3 |
| Manage unit progression | Not planned | Depends on Phases 4/5/6 |
| Deploy to production | Not planned | Depends on Phase 7 |

## Recommendations

### Immediate: Execute Phase 1
Phase 1 plans are solid. Proceed with `/gsd:execute-phase 1`.

### Before Phase 2 Planning
1. Define format→match form interface: component switching vs field-level conditional rendering
2. Specify how `matches.post.ts` validates format-specific constraints (e.g., OW PtG 2-game cap)

### Before Phase 3 Planning
1. Plan `useStandings` refactor to accept format parameter
2. Add unit tests for existing standings logic BEFORE refactor

### Before Phase 7 Planning
1. Define deploy sequence: schema migration → code deploy → migration script
2. Add rollback plan for migration script
