## ✅ What Has Been Done

### 1. **Database Layer** ✓

- Fields: id, playerId, round, unitName, totalModels, paintedModels, points, lastUpdated, createdAt
- Foreign key relationship to players table
- Migration file generated: `migrations/0003_lumpy_mockingbird.sql`

### 2. **API Endpoints** ✓
Created three new API endpoints:

### 3. **State Management** ✓

- Detailed progress for each player and round
- Overall painting statistics
- Quick access to add/edit unit progress

### 6. **Navigation** ✓
Added "🎨 Painting" link to main navigation menu

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The painting feature is designed to:
- ✅ Encourage players to paint their armies
