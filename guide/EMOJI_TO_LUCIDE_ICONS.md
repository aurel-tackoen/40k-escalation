# Emoji to Lucide Icons Migration

## Overview
All emojis have been replaced with Lucide Vue Next icons for better consistency and accessibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. **ArmyListsView.vue** - Copy Army Button
**Location**: `app/components/views/ArmyListsView.vue` (line ~549)

**Before**:
```vue
{{ hasPreviousRoundArmy ? 'üìã Copy Army' : 'No Previous Army' }}
```

**After**:
```vue
<Clipboard v-if="hasPreviousRoundArmy" :size="18" />
<span>{{ hasPreviousRoundArmy ? 'Copy Army' : 'No Previous Army' }}</span>
```

**Icon Added**: `Clipboard` from `lucide-vue-next`
- Visual indicator for the copy action
- Only shows when a previous army exists
- Size 18px for button context

---

### 2. **leagues/index.vue** - Delete Confirmation
**Location**: `app/pages/leagues/index.vue` (line ~57)

**Before**:
```javascript
confirm(`‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Are you sure you want to DELETE...`)
```

**After**:
```javascript
confirm(`WARNING: Are you sure you want to DELETE...`)
```

**Change**: Removed emoji from confirmation dialog
- Browser native dialogs don't need emojis
- Text "WARNING:" is clear enough
- Maintains urgency without emoji

---

### 3. **LeagueSetupView.vue** - Game System Warning
**Location**: `app/components/views/LeagueSetupView.vue` (line ~268)

**Before**:
```vue
<p class="text-xs text-gray-400 mt-1">
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Changing the game system will update available factions and missions
</p>
```

**After**:
```vue
<p class="text-xs text-gray-400 mt-1 flex items-center gap-1.5">
  <AlertTriangle :size="14" class="text-yellow-500 flex-shrink-0" />
  <span>Changing the game system will update available factions and missions</span>
</p>
```

**Icon Added**: `AlertTriangle` from `lucide-vue-next`
- Size 14px for small text context
- Yellow color to emphasize warning
- `flex-shrink-0` prevents icon from shrinking

---

### 4. **leagues.js** - Console Logs
**Location**: `app/stores/leagues.js` (lines ~262, ~268)

**Before**:
```javascript
console.log('üîç fetchPublicLeagues - userId:', ...)
console.log('üì• Public leagues response:', ...)
```

**After**:
```javascript
console.log('[fetchPublicLeagues] userId:', ...)
console.log('[fetchPublicLeagues] Public leagues response:', ...)
```

**Change**: Standard bracket notation for log prefixes
- More professional for production code
- Better for log filtering/searching
- Consistent with logging best practices
