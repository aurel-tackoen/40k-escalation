## üìù Changes Made

### 1. Data Files Updated

#### `app/data/game-systems.js`
Added new game system:
```javascript
{
  name: 'The Horus Heresy',
  shortName: 'hh',
  description: 'The Age of Darkness - Forge your Legion\'s legacy'

| Troops | Core | 2 |
| Elites | Specialist | 3 |

| Heavy Support | Specialist | 5 |
| Lord of War | Command | 6 |
| **Primarch** | Command | 7 |

| **Legion Specific** | Special | 10 |

*Note: Primarch and Legion Specific are unique to Horus Heresy*

### 2. Bug Fix: Seed Duplicate Detection

**Problem Discovered**: The seed endpoint was checking for duplicates by **name only**, not by **gameSystemId + name**. This caused:
- Factions with same name across systems to be skipped (e.g., "Dark Angels" in both 40k and HH)
- Unit types with same name to be skipped (e.g., "HQ" in both 40k and HH)

**Solution**: Updated `server/api/seed-game-systems.post.ts` to check both `gameSystemId` and `name`:

```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
const existing = await db
  .select()
  .from(factions)
  .where(eq(factions.name, faction.name))
  .limit(1)

// AFTER (correct)
const existing = await db
  .select()
  .from(factions)
  .where(and(
    eq(factions.gameSystemId, system.id),
    eq(factions.name, faction.name)
  ))
  .limit(1)
```

Applied to all three entities:
- ‚úÖ Factions
- ‚úÖ Missions
- ‚úÖ Unit Types

---

### 3. Database Seeding Results

**First Seed Attempt** (with bug):
```json
{
  "gameSystems": 5,
  "factions": 121,  // Missing HH duplicates
  "missions": 68,
  "unitTypes": 33,  // Missing HH duplicates
  "created": {
    "factions": 11,  // Only unique names
    "missions": 15,
    "unitTypes": 0   // All duplicates skipped
  }
}
```

**Second Seed** (after fix):
```json
{
  "gameSystems": 5,
  "factions": 139,  // ‚úÖ All HH factions
  "missions": 69,
  "unitTypes": 43,  // ‚úÖ All HH unit types
  "created": {
    "factions": 18,  // Added previously skipped
    "missions": 1,
    "unitTypes": 10  // Added previously skipped
  }
}
```

### 4. Documentation Updated

Updated `AGENTS.md` in 4 locations:

1. **Header Section**: Updated game systems count from 4‚Üí5 with full breakdown
2. **Project Structure**: Updated file comments with new totals
3. **Multi-Game System Architecture**: Updated table with HH row and unit types column
4. **Project Achievements**: Updated totals in achievements list

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create new league with "The Horus Heresy" game system
- [ ] Add player with HH faction (e.g., "Sons of Horus")
- [ ] Verify faction dropdown shows only HH factions
- [ ] Create army with HH unit types (verify "Primarch" appears)
- [ ] Record match with HH mission (e.g., "Tide of Carnage")
- [ ] Verify mission dropdown shows only HH missions
- [ ] Export players CSV with HH factions
- [ ] Check game system badge displays "The Horus Heresy"

### API Verification
```bash
# Check game systems (should show 5)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/game-systems | jq '.data | length'

# Check HH factions (should show 29)
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/factions?gameSystemId=5" | jq '.data | length'

# Check HH missions (should show 15)
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/missions?gameSystemId=5" | jq '.data | length'

# Check HH unit types (should show 10)
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/unit-types?gameSystemId=5" | jq '.data | length'
```

## üìä Content Breakdown by Game System

| Game System | Factions | Missions | Unit Types | Total |
|-------------|----------|----------|------------|-------|
| Warhammer 40,000 | 40 | 15 | 9 | 64 |
| Age of Sigmar | 24 | 13 | 8 | 45 |
| The Old World | 17 | 12 | 7 | 36 |

| **The Horus Heresy** | **29** | **15** | **10** | **54** |
| **TOTAL** | **139** | **69** | **43** | **251** |

---

## üêõ Issues Fixed

1. **Duplicate Detection Bug** - Fixed seed endpoint to check `gameSystemId + name` instead of name only
2. **Missing Import** - Added `and` to drizzle-orm imports in seed endpoint

---

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Always check for duplicate handling** when dealing with multi-tenant or multi-system data
2. **Composite keys matter** - Name alone isn't unique across game systems
3. **Test seeding thoroughly** - The bug wasn't apparent until HH added overlapping names
4. **Document as you go** - Updated AGENTS.md immediately for future reference

## üéØ Future Enhancements

Potential additions for Horus Heresy support:
- [ ] Zone Mortalis-specific missions
- [ ] Primarch-specific rules/bonuses
- [ ] Legion Rites of War (special army building rules)
- [ ] Horus Heresy-specific painting schemes
- [ ] Campaign/narrative mission packs

**Implementation Time**: ~2 hours  
**Files Modified**: 5  
**Lines Added**: ~120  
**Risk Level**: ‚úÖ LOW - Purely additive, no breaking changes
