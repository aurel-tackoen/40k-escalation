# Component Migration Complete - Phase 3.2 ✅

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: All Components Updated to Multi-League Store

---

## 🎯 Migration Summary

Successfully migrated all 5 page components from `useLeagueStore` to `useLeaguesStore`.

---

## 📝 Updated Components

### 1. `/pages/dashboard.vue`
**Changes:**
- ✅ Import updated to `useLeaguesStore`
- ✅ Initialization changed from `fetchAll()` to `initialize()`
- ✅ Added "No league selected" state with link to `/leagues`
- ✅ Updated store reference from `leagueStore` to `leaguesStore`

**Key Code:**
```vue
<script setup>
  import { useLeaguesStore } from '~/stores/leagues'
  const leaguesStore = useLeaguesStore()
  const { currentLeague: league, players, matches, armies, loading, error } = storeToRefs(leaguesStore)
  
  onMounted(async () => {
    await leaguesStore.initialize()
  })
</script>

<template>
  <div v-else-if="!league" class="text-center py-8">
    No league selected. <NuxtLink to="/leagues">Choose a league</NuxtLink>
  </div>
</template>
```

### 2. `/pages/players.vue`
**Changes:**
- ✅ Import updated to `useLeaguesStore`
- ✅ Initialization simplified to single `initialize()` call
- ✅ Added "No league selected" state
- ✅ Store references updated throughout

**Before:**
```vue
onMounted(async () => {
  await leagueStore.fetchPlayers()
  await leagueStore.fetchArmies()
  await leagueStore.fetchLeague()
})
```

**After:**
```vue
onMounted(async () => {
  await leaguesStore.initialize()
})
```

### 3. `/pages/armies.vue`
**Changes:**
- ✅ Import updated to `useLeaguesStore`
- ✅ Removed manual Promise.all for multiple fetches
- ✅ Added "No league selected" state
- ✅ Store references updated

**Simplification:**
- Old: 3 separate fetch calls in Promise.all
- New: Single initialize() call handles everything

### 4. `/pages/matches.vue`
**Changes:**
- ✅ Import updated to `useLeaguesStore`
- ✅ Simplified data fetching
- ✅ Added "No league selected" state
- ✅ Added `currentLeague` to reactive refs

### 5. `/pages/setup.vue`
**Changes:**
- ✅ Import updated to `useLeaguesStore`
- ✅ Added permission check with `canManageLeague` getter
- ✅ Added "No league selected" state
- ✅ Added permission denied message for non-organizers

**New Permission UI:**
```vue
<div v-else-if="!canManageLeague" class="text-center py-8 text-red-400">
  You do not have permission to edit league settings. 
  Only league owners and organizers can modify settings.
</div>
```

## 🗑️ Cleanup

### Removed Files
- ✅ `app/stores/league.js` - Old single-league store (replaced by `leagues.js`)

---

## 🔧 Common Patterns Applied

### 1. Store Import Pattern
All components now use:
```vue
<script setup>
  import { useLeaguesStore } from '~/stores/leagues'
  const leaguesStore = useLeaguesStore()
</script>
```

### 2. Initialization Pattern
All components now use single initialization:
```vue
onMounted(async () => {
  await leaguesStore.initialize()
})
```

**What `initialize()` does:**
1. Restores `currentLeagueId` from localStorage
2. Fetches user's leagues via `/api/leagues/my`
3. If no league selected but user has leagues, selects first one
4. Fetches all data for selected league (players, matches, armies, members)

### 3. League Selection Check Pattern
All components now have:
```vue
<template>
  <div v-if="loading">Loading...</div>
  <div v-else-if="!league">
    No league selected. <NuxtLink to="/leagues">Choose a league</NuxtLink>
  </div>
  <ComponentView v-else :league="league" ... />
</template>
```

### 4. Store Reference Updates
All store references updated:
- `leagueStore` → `leaguesStore`
- `league` → `currentLeague: league` (destructured with alias)
- All event handlers updated (e.g., `@add-player="leaguesStore.addPlayer"`)

---

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

### Before Migration
- No visual indication of league context
- Silent failures if no league data
- No permission checks on UI level

### After Migration
- Clear "No league selected" messages with action link
- Permission-based UI rendering (setup page)
- Consistent initialization across all pages
- Automatic league restoration from localStorage

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Needed
- [ ] Dashboard loads with league selected
- [ ] Dashboard shows "No league selected" when appropriate
- [ ] Players page loads and allows adding players
- [ ] Armies page loads and allows creating armies
- [ ] Matches page loads and allows recording matches
- [ ] Setup page shows only to owners/organizers
- [ ] Setup page blocks non-organizers with message
- [ ] All pages redirect to `/leagues` when no league selected (once that page exists)

### Store Integration Tests
- [ ] `initialize()` restores last selected league
- [ ] All CRUD operations include leagueId automatically
- [ ] Data fetching scoped to current league
- [ ] League switching updates all page data

## ✅ Validation

### Build Check
```bash
npm run lint  # ✅ 0 errors
```

### Type Safety
- All store methods properly typed
- Composable patterns maintained
- Reactive refs correctly used

### Code Quality
- Consistent coding style
- DRY principles applied (single initialize pattern)
- Improved error handling
- Better UX with clear messaging

## 📖 Developer Notes

### Store Backward Compatibility
**Breaking Changes:**
- `useLeagueStore` → `useLeaguesStore` (name change)
- `league` getter → `currentLeague` getter
- `fetchAll()` → `initialize()` method
- All fetch methods now require active `currentLeagueId`

**Non-Breaking:**
- All CRUD operations maintain same signature
- Getters like `paintingLeaderboard` unchanged
- Event handlers remain compatible

### Migration Tips for Future Components
1. Always import `useLeaguesStore` from `~/stores/leagues`
2. Use `initialize()` for initial data load
3. Check `hasActiveLeague` or `currentLeague` before rendering content
4. Use permission getters (`isLeagueOwner`, `canManageLeague`) for role-based UI
5. Trust automatic leagueId injection - don't pass it manually
