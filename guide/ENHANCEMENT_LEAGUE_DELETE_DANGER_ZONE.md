# Enhancement: League Deletion (Danger Zone)

## Overview
Added a "Danger Zone" section to the League Setup page allowing league owners to permanently delete their leagues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Delete Functionality

**File**: `/app/components/views/LeagueSetupView.vue`

**New Function** (`deleteLeague`):
```javascript
const deleteLeague = async () => {
  if (!editableLeague.value?.id) return

  // Confirmation dialog with detailed warning
  const confirmDelete = confirm(
    `Are you sure you want to delete "${editableLeague.value.name}"?\n\n` +
    `This will permanently delete:\n` +
    `‚Ä¢ All league data\n` +
    `‚Ä¢ All player records\n` +
    `‚Ä¢ All army lists\n` +
    `‚Ä¢ All match results\n\n` +
    `This action cannot be undone!`
  )

  if (!confirmDelete) return

  // Check authentication
  const authStore = useAuthStore()
  if (!authStore.user?.id) {
    alert('You must be logged in to delete the league')
    return
  }

  try {
    // Call DELETE API
    await $fetch(`/api/leagues/${editableLeague.value.id}`, {
      method: 'DELETE',
      body: {
        userId: authStore.user.id
      }
    })

    alert('League deleted successfully')

    // Redirect to leagues page
    window.location.href = '/leagues'
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to delete league:', error)
    alert('Failed to delete league. Please try again.')
  }
}
```

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Requires user authentication
- ‚úÖ Detailed confirmation dialog listing what will be deleted
- ‚úÖ Only league owner can delete (enforced by API)
- ‚úÖ Success notification
- ‚úÖ Auto-redirect to leagues page after deletion
- ‚úÖ Error handling with user-friendly alerts

### 2. Added UI Section

**New Template Section** (Danger Zone):
```vue
<div class="card border-2 border-red-600/50 bg-red-950/20">
  <div class="flex items-center gap-3 mb-6">
    <AlertTriangle class="text-red-500" :size="28" />
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-red-500">Danger Zone</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="space-y-4">
    <div class="bg-red-900/30 border border-red-600/50 rounded-lg p-4">
      <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-red-400 mb-2">Delete This League</h4>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Once you delete a league, there is no going back. This will permanently delete all league data,
        player records, army lists, and match results.
      </p>
      <button
        @click="deleteLeague"
        class="btn-secondary flex items-center justify-center gap-2 cursor-pointer w-full sm:w-auto bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 border-red-500"
      >
        <Trash2 :size="18" />
        <span>Delete League</span>
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Visual Design**:
- üî¥ Red color scheme (danger indication)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è AlertTriangle icon
- üé® Red border and background with transparency
- üì± Responsive button (full width on mobile, auto on desktop)
- üóëÔ∏è Trash icon on delete button

### 3. Added Icon Import

**Updated imports**:
```javascript
import { Save, Plus, Trash2, Settings as SettingsIcon, Share2, Copy, RefreshCw, Link, Globe, Lock, RotateCcw, AlertTriangle } from 'lucide-vue-next'
```

Added: `AlertTriangle` for the Danger Zone header

## API Endpoint Used

### DELETE `/api/leagues/:id`

**Existing endpoint** - No changes required

**Request**:
```typescript
DELETE /api/leagues/:id
Body: {
  userId: 123  // Required for authentication
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "League deleted successfully"
}
```

**Security**:
- ‚úÖ Requires valid user ID
- ‚úÖ Checks user is a member of the league
- ‚úÖ **Only league owner can delete** (role: 'owner')
- ‚úÖ Returns 403 Forbidden if user is not owner

**Cascade Deletion**:
The API handles manual cascade deletion for:
1. **Rounds** - Deleted manually (no CASCADE in schema)
2. **Matches** - Deleted manually (no CASCADE in schema)
3. **Players** - Deleted via CASCADE (onDelete: 'cascade')
4. **Armies** - Deleted via CASCADE (onDelete: 'cascade')
5. **League Memberships** - Deleted via CASCADE (onDelete: 'cascade')

## User Flow

### Step 1: Navigate to League Settings
- User must be league owner
- Scroll to bottom of page
- See "Danger Zone" section with red styling

### Step 2: Initiate Delete
- Click "Delete League" button
- Red button with Trash icon
- Clear warning message visible

### Step 3: Confirm Deletion
- Browser confirmation dialog appears
- Lists all data that will be deleted:
  - All league data
  - All player records
  - All army lists
  - All match results
- Warns "This action cannot be undone!"
- User must click "OK" to proceed

### Step 4: Processing
- API call to `DELETE /api/leagues/:id`
- Authentication checked
- Owner permission verified
- All related data deleted

### Step 5: Completion
- Success alert: "League deleted successfully"
- Auto-redirect to `/leagues` page
- League no longer exists in database

## Error Handling

### Authentication Error
```javascript
if (!authStore.user?.id) {
  alert('You must be logged in to delete the league')
  return
}
```

### Permission Error (from API)
```json
{
  "statusCode": 403,
  "statusMessage": "Only league owner can delete the league"
}
```
Shows: "Failed to delete league. Please try again."

### Network Error
```javascript
catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to delete league:', error)
  alert('Failed to delete league. Please try again.')
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Frontend Protection
- ‚úÖ Requires user authentication
- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
- ‚úÖ Clear warning about permanent data loss

### Backend Protection (API)
- ‚úÖ User ID validation
- ‚úÖ League membership check
- ‚úÖ Owner role verification
- ‚úÖ Only owner can delete (not organizers or players)

### Data Integrity
- ‚úÖ Proper cascade deletion order
- ‚úÖ Manual deletion for tables without CASCADE
- ‚úÖ Atomic operation (all or nothing)

## Visual Design

### Color Scheme
- Background: `bg-red-950/20` (very dark red, 20% opacity)
- Border: `border-red-600/50` (red, 50% opacity)
- Header text: `text-red-500`
- Button: `bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700`

### Layout
- Positioned at bottom of page (after "Scoring & Rules")
- Full card with prominent border
- Warning icon and "Danger Zone" title
- Descriptive text explaining consequences
- Single action button (delete only)
