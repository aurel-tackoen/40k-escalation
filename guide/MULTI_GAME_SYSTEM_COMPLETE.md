# Multi-Game System Refactor - COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION READY  
**Completion**: 95% (Documentation remaining)

---

## 🎉 Summary

Successfully refactored the Warhammer 40K Escalation League Manager to support **4 game systems**:
- Warhammer 40,000 (40k)
- Age of Sigmar (AoS)
- The Old World (ToW)
- Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game (MESBG)

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks (9/10)

### 1. Database Schema ✅
- Created `game_systems` table (5 columns, serial PK)
- Created `factions` table (6 columns, foreign key to game_systems)
- Created `missions` table (6 columns, foreign key to game_systems)
- Added `gameSystemId` to `leagues` table (NOT NULL, foreign key)
- Migration includes backward compatibility (existing leagues → 40k)
- **Migration File**: `migrations/0008_nostalgic_human_cannonball.sql`

### 2. Database Migration ✅
- Generated migration with `npm run db:generate`
- Applied migration successfully with `npm run db:migrate`
- Handles existing data gracefully with default values
- Zero data loss during migration

### 3. Seed Data ✅
- Created comprehensive seed endpoint: `POST /api/seed-game-systems`
- Seeded successfully with:
  - **4 game systems**
  - **110 factions** (40k: 40, AoS: 24, ToW: 17, MESBG: 29)
  - **53 missions** across all systems
- Idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)
- Uses dynamic imports to avoid build-time resolution issues

### 4. API Endpoints ✅

**New Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/game-systems` - List all active game systems
- `GET /api/factions?gameSystemId=X` - Get factions filtered by game system
- `GET /api/missions?gameSystemId=X` - Get missions filtered by game system
- `POST /api/seed-game-systems` - Populate database (idempotent)

**Updated Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/leagues/create` - Now requires `gameSystemId`
- `PATCH /api/leagues/[id]` - Now supports updating `gameSystemId`

**All endpoints tested and working** ✅

### 5. Pinia Store ✅

**New State**:
```javascript
gameSystems: []            // Available game systems
currentGameSystem: null    // Active game system for current league
factions: []               // Factions for current game system
missions: []               // Missions for current game system
```

**New Getters**:
- `currentGameSystemName` - Returns current game system name
- `availableFactions` - Returns factions array  
- `availableMissions` - Returns missions array

**New Actions**:
- `fetchGameSystems()` - Fetch all game systems
- `fetchFactions(gameSystemId)` - Fetch factions for specific game system
- `fetchMissions(gameSystemId)` - Fetch missions for specific game system

**Updated Actions**:
- `switchLeague(leagueId)` - Now automatically fetches game system data

**App Initialization**:
- `app.vue` - Fetches game systems on mount

### 6. Component Updates ✅

**PlayersView.vue**:
- ✅ Replaced static factions with `availableFactions` from store
- ✅ Dynamic faction dropdown shows category (Imperium, Chaos, etc.)
- ✅ Shows current game system name in label
- ✅ Factions update automatically when switching leagues

**MatchesView.vue**:
- ✅ Replaced static missions with `availableMissions` from store
- ✅ Dynamic mission dropdown shows category (Matched Play, Narrative, etc.)
- ✅ Shows current game system name in label
- ✅ Missions update automatically when switching leagues

**DashboardView.vue**:
- ✅ Added game system badge in header
- ✅ Badge shows current game system name
- ✅ Purple theme styling for game system indicator

**League Creation (`pages/leagues/create.vue`)**:
- ✅ Added game system selector (required field)
- ✅ Dropdown populated from store's `gameSystems`
- ✅ Added validation (game system required)
- ✅ Shows helpful text explaining game system impact
- ✅ Form includes `gameSystemId` in submission

### 7. Data Files ✅

**Created**:
- `app/data/game-systems.js` - 4 game systems with metadata
- `app/data/factions-by-system.js` - 110+ factions organized by system
- `app/data/missions-by-system.js` - 53 missions organized by system

**Removed**:
- `app/data/factions.js` - No longer needed (replaced by dynamic data)
- `app/data/missions.js` - No longer needed (replaced by dynamic data)

### 8. Documentation ✅

**Created**:
- `guide/MULTI_GAME_SYSTEM_REFACTOR.md` - Complete implementation guide
- `guide/GAME_SYSTEMS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Developer & user reference
- `guide/MULTI_GAME_SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md` - This completion summary

**To Update**:
- `AGENTS.md` - Add multi-game system architecture section

### 9. Code Quality ✅
- ✅ Zero lint errors (`npm run lint` passes)
- ✅ Auto-fixed all warnings
- ✅ All imports use correct paths (relative for server, aliases for app)
- ✅ Proper error handling in all API endpoints
- ✅ Composables remain game-agnostic (no changes needed)

## 📊 Database Statistics

| Table | Records | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| game_systems | 4 | All active |
| factions | 110 | Distributed across 4 systems |
| missions | 53 | Distributed across 4 systems |
| leagues | * | All assigned to game system (migration) |

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Import Path Strategy
- **Server API**: Relative paths (`../../db`, `../../app/data/...`)
- **App Components**: Nuxt aliases (`~/stores/...`, `~/composables/...`)
- **Dynamic Imports**: Used in seed endpoint to avoid build-time resolution

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing leagues automatically assigned to Warhammer 40,000 (gameSystemId = 1)
- Migration includes proper NULL handling and default values
- No user action required for existing data

### Data Validation
- Factions validated against league's game system
- Missions validated against league's game system  
- Game system required for new leagues
- League owners/organizers can change game system

### Performance
- Factions/missions fetched once per league switch
- Cached in Pinia store (no redundant API calls)
- Lightweight API responses (only active records)

---

## 🎯 What Works Now

### League Creation
1. Select game system (required)
2. Game system determines available factions/missions
3. Creates league with gameSystemId

### Player Management
1. Join league as player
2. Select faction from current game system's factions
3. Faction dropdown shows categories (Imperium, Chaos, Order, etc.)

### Match Recording
1. Record match
2. Select mission from current game system's missions
3. Mission dropdown organized by category (Matched Play, Narrative, etc.)

### League Switching
1. Switch to different league
2. Game system data loads automatically
3. Factions/missions update for new game system
4. Dashboard shows game system badge
