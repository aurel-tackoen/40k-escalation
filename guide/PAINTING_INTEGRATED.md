# 🎨 Painting Progress - Integrated Implementation

## Overview
Painting progress is now fully integrated into the Army Lists system! Track painted models directly when building your army lists—no separate data entry needed.

## ✅ What Changed

### Simplified Approach
Instead of a separate painting tracking system, painting progress is now:
- **Tracked directly on army units** when you build your army list
- **Automatically calculated** from army data
- **Displayed in real-time** on army cards
- **Shows on a leaderboard** in the dashboard

### Key Benefits
- ✅ **No duplicate data entry** - enter model counts once with your army
- ✅ **Automatic tracking** - update painting as you complete models
- ✅ **Visual feedback** - see progress bars on every unit and army
- ✅ **Competitive element** - leaderboard on dashboard shows who's painting the most

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Building an Army List (Army Lists Page)

When creating or editing an army, each unit now has:
- **Unit Name** - e.g., "Intercessors Squad"
- **Type** - HQ, Troops, Elites, etc.
- **Points** - Point cost of the unit
- **Total Models** - How many models are in the unit (e.g., 10)
- **🎨 Painted** - How many models are painted (e.g., 7)

As you enter this data, you'll see a live painting progress bar under each unit showing your completion percentage.

### 2. Viewing Army Cards

Army cards now display:
- **Painting Progress Summary** - Overall percentage for the entire army
- **Color-coded progress bar**:
  - 🔴 Red (0-30%) - Just getting started
  - 🟡 Orange (31-70%) - Making progress
  - 🟢 Green (71-99%) - Almost there!
  - 🟣 Purple (100%) - Fully Painted! ✨
- **Individual unit progress** - Each unit shows its own painting status
- **Model counts** - X/Y models painted for each unit

### 3. Dashboard Leaderboard

The dashboard now features a **Painting Leaderboard** showing:
- 🥇🥈🥉 Medals for top 3 painters
- Player name and faction
- Total models painted / total models
- Completion percentage
- Color-coded progress bars

## 📊 Features

### Unit-Level Tracking
```
Example Unit:
Name: Intercessors Squad
Points: 100
Total Models: 10
Painted: 7
Progress: 70% (orange/green)
```

### Army-Level Stats
Automatically calculated from all units:
- Total models in army
- Total painted models
- Overall painted percentage
- Visual "Fully Painted" badge at 100%

### Leaderboard
Players ranked by painting completion percentage for the current round.

## 🎨 Color Coding

| Percentage | Color | Meaning |
|------------|-------|---------|
| 0-30% | 🔴 Red | Low progress |
| 31-70% | 🟡 Orange | Medium progress |
| 71-99% | 🟢 Green | High progress |
| 100% | 🟣 Purple | Fully Painted! ✨ |

## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Players
1. When building your army list, add the `Total Models` count for each unit
2. As you paint models, update the `Painted` field
3. Watch your progress bars fill up!
4. Aim for that purple "Fully Painted" status!

### For League Organizers
- Encourage players to keep their painting progress updated
- Use the leaderboard to recognize painting achievements
- Consider awarding bonus points for fully painted armies
- Share the leaderboard to motivate painters

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Data Structure
Painting data is stored directly in the army units:
```javascript
{
  name: "Intercessors",
  type: "Troops",
  points: 100,
  totalModels: 10,        // NEW
  paintedModels: 7,       // NEW
  equipment: "..."
}
```

### Calculation
The store automatically calculates leaderboard from army data:
```javascript
// In store getters:
paintingLeaderboard: (state) => {
  // Finds all armies for current round
  // Calculates painted percentage per player
  // Sorts by percentage (highest first)
  // Returns leaderboard array
}
```

### Components
- `ArmyListsView.vue` - Army builder with painting fields
- `PaintingProgress.vue` - Leaderboard display component
- `DashboardView.vue` - Shows leaderboard

## 📝 Files Changed

### Modified:
- ✏️ `app/components/ArmyListsView.vue` - Added painting fields to units
