# Army Name Editing in Update Profile Form - Implementation Complete

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Type**: Feature Enhancement  
**Location**: Players View → "Update Your Profile" Form

## 🎯 Overview

Army name editing is now integrated into the **"Update Your Profile"** form section on the Players page. Users can update their display name, faction, and army name all in one place.

### Why This Location Makes Sense
- **Single Form**: All player profile updates in one place
- **Clear Context**: Only shows when user is already a player in the league
- **League-Specific**: Army name is league-specific, managed alongside other league profile data
- **Simple UX**: No inline editing needed, just a form field

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Players View → "Update Your Profile" Form
  ↓
User already joined league (isCurrentUserPlayer = true)
  ↓
Form pre-fills: name, faction, armyName
  ↓
User edits any field (including army name)
  ↓
User clicks "Update Profile"
  ↓
1. emit('update-player') - Updates name & faction
  ↓
2. If armyName changed:
   PUT /api/users/me/army-name
   {userId, leagueId, armyName}
  ↓
UPDATE league_memberships
  SET army_name = 'New Name'
  WHERE user_id = X AND league_id = Y
  ↓
Update local state
  ↓
Show success message: "✓ Army name updated successfully!"
```

## 📁 Files Modified

### 1. `server/api/players.get.ts`

**Added league_memberships JOIN**:
```typescript
// Get players for specific league with armyName from league_memberships
const playersWithArmyNames = await db
  .select({
    id: players.id,
    leagueId: players.leagueId,
    userId: players.userId,
    name: players.name,
    faction: players.faction,
    wins: players.wins,
    losses: players.losses,
    draws: players.draws,
    totalPoints: players.totalPoints,
    createdAt: players.createdAt,
    armyName: leagueMemberships.armyName  // ← Added from JOIN
  })
  .from(players)
  .leftJoin(
    leagueMemberships,
    eq(players.userId, leagueMemberships.userId)
  )
  .where(eq(players.leagueId, leagueId))
```

**Why LEFT JOIN?**
- Some players might not have a league_membership record yet
- Returns `null` for armyName if no membership exists
- Prevents excluding players without army names

### 2. `app/components/views/PlayersView.vue`

**Updated Form State**:
```javascript
const {
  formData: newPlayer,
  resetForm,
  isFormValid,
  updateField
} = useFormManagement({
  name: '',
  faction: '',
  armyName: ''  // ← Added army name to form
})

// Success/error state for army name update
const armyNameUpdateSuccess = ref(false)
const armyNameUpdateError = ref(null)

// Pre-fill form with current player data when user is already a player
watch(currentUserPlayer, (player) => {
  if (player) {
    updateField('name', player.name)
    updateField('faction', player.faction)
    updateField('armyName', player.armyName || '')  // ← Pre-fill army name
  }
}, { immediate: true })
```

**Updated Submit Function**:
```javascript
const submitPlayer = async () => {
  if (!isAuthenticated.value || !user.value) {
    alert('You must be logged in to join as a player')
    return
  }

  armyNameUpdateSuccess.value = false
  armyNameUpdateError.value = null

  if (isFormValid(['name', 'faction'])) {
    if (isCurrentUserPlayer.value) {
      // Update existing player
      emit('update-player', {
        id: currentUserPlayer.value.id,
        name: newPlayer.value.name,
        faction: newPlayer.value.faction
      })

      // Also update army name if changed
      if (newPlayer.value.armyName && newPlayer.value.armyName.trim() !== '') {
        try {
          await $fetch(`/api/users/me/army-name`, {
            method: 'PUT',
            body: {
              userId: currentUserPlayer.value.userId,
              leagueId: currentUserPlayer.value.leagueId,
              armyName: newPlayer.value.armyName.trim()
            }
          })

          // Update local state
          currentUserPlayer.value.armyName = newPlayer.value.armyName.trim()
          armyNameUpdateSuccess.value = true
          setTimeout(() => { armyNameUpdateSuccess.value = false }, 3000)
        } catch (error) {
          armyNameUpdateError.value = 'Failed to update army name'
          console.error('Error updating army name:', error)
        }
      }
    } else {
      // Add new player (no army name needed yet)
      emit('add-player', {
        name: newPlayer.value.name,
        faction: newPlayer.value.faction,
        userId: user.value.id
      })
      resetForm()
    }
  }
}
```

**UI Changes (Player Card - View Only)**:
```vue
<!-- Army Name (View Only in Card) -->
<div v-if="player.armyName" class="text-xs text-yellow-500 flex items-center gap-1 mt-1">
  <Swords :size="12" />
  <span>{{ player.armyName }}</span>
</div>
```

**UI Changes (Update Profile Form)**:
```vue
<!-- Army Name Field (only show when updating profile) -->
<div v-if="isCurrentUserPlayer">
  <label class="block text-sm font-semibold text-yellow-500 mb-2 flex items-center gap-2">
    <Swords :size="16" />
    Army Name
  </label>
  <input
    v-model="newPlayer.armyName"
    type="text"
    class="input-field"
    placeholder="Enter your army name (e.g., Emperor's Fist)"
    maxlength="255"
  />
  <p class="text-xs text-gray-400 mt-1">
    This name will be used for all your armies in this league (e.g., "Emperor's Fist - Round 1")
  </p>
  
  <!-- Success/Error Messages -->
  <div v-if="armyNameUpdateSuccess" class="text-sm text-green-400 mt-2 flex items-center gap-1">
    ✓ Army name updated successfully!
  </div>
  <div v-if="armyNameUpdateError" class="text-sm text-red-400 mt-2">
    {{ armyNameUpdateError }}
  </div>
</div>
```

### 3. `app/components/views/ProfileView.vue`

**Removed**:
- ❌ `Edit`, `X`, `Check` icon imports
- ❌ `editingArmyName`, `editArmyNameValue`, `armyNameError`, `armyNameSuccess` state
- ❌ `startEditingArmyName()`, `cancelEditingArmyName()`, `saveArmyName()` functions
- ❌ Inline editing UI (both mobile and desktop)

**Kept** (View Only):
```vue
<!-- Army Name (View Only) -->
<div class="text-xs text-yellow-500 flex items-center gap-1 mt-1">
  <Swords :size="12" />
  <span>{{ player.armyName || 'No army name set' }}</span>
</div>
```

**Rationale**:
- Profile page is for viewing user's overall stats across leagues
- Players page is for managing league-specific data
- Army names are league-specific, so editing belongs in Players view

## 🔄 User Experience Flow

### Happy Path
1. User joins league (becomes a player)
2. User goes to **Players** page
3. Scrolls down to **"Update Your Profile"** form
4. Form is pre-filled with current name, faction, and army name
5. User edits army name field
6. User clicks **"Update Profile"** button
7. Success message appears: "✓ Army name updated successfully!"
8. New name is immediately visible in player card above
9. New armies created will use this name

### Form Behavior
- **When NOT a player**: Form shows "Join as Player" - no army name field
- **When IS a player**: Form shows "Update Your Profile" - includes army name field
- **Pre-fill**: All fields automatically filled with current values
- **Validation**: Name and faction required, army name optional
- **Updates**: Both player data (name/faction) and army name updated together

### Success/Error Feedback
- **Success**: Green message "✓ Army name updated successfully!" (3 second timeout)
- **Error**: Red message "Failed to update army name" (stays until next attempt)
- **No validation error**: Army name is optional, can be left empty

---

## ✅ Benefits

### Single Form Editing
- **All in One Place**: Name, faction, and army name together
- **No Inline Editing**: Simpler UX without edit/cancel buttons
- **Clear Context**: Only shows when user is a player
- **Consistent Pattern**: Same form pattern as join flow

### User Control
- **Pre-filled Values**: See current values immediately
- **Optional Field**: Army name can be empty (no forced requirement)
- **Immediate Feedback**: Success/error messages right in the form
- **Simple Flow**: Edit → Submit → Done

### Developer Experience
- **Single Submit Handler**: One function handles all updates
- **Form Management**: Uses existing useFormManagement composable
- **Clean Separation**: Player cards = view, Form = edit
- **No State Complexity**: No inline editing state to manage
