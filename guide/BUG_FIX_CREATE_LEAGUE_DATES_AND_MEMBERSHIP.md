# Bug Fixes: Create League Issues (Bug #4 & #5)

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Severity**: High (blocking feature)

---

## Overview

Two related issues prevented successful league creation via the UI form at `/leagues/create`:

1. **Bug #4**: Invalid date syntax - Empty strings sent for round dates
2. **Bug #5**: Missing membership data - API response missing `membership` object

Both bugs occurred during the same user action (submitting the create league form) but were separate issues requiring different fixes.

## Bug #4: Invalid Date Syntax for Round Dates

### Issue Description

When creating a league with rounds that had empty date fields, the API failed with:

```
ERROR Error creating league: Failed query: insert into "rounds" 
params: 6,1,500 Points,500,,

[cause]: invalid input syntax for type date: ""
```

### Root Cause

**Empty String vs Null Problem**:
- Form initialized round dates as empty strings: `startDate: ''`, `endDate: ''`
- HTML date inputs left empty return empty strings (`""`)
- PostgreSQL `date` type rejects empty strings but accepts `null`
- No validation checked if round dates were filled in
- Empty strings were passed directly to database causing SQL error

### User Impact
- Users could not create leagues even with valid data
- Form appeared to submit but failed with cryptic database error
- No clear indication that round dates were required

---

### Solution for Bug #4

Implemented **three-layer defense**:

#### 1. Client-Side Validation
Added validation to check round dates are filled:

```javascript
// app/pages/leagues/create.vue - validateForm()
for (const round of form.rounds) {
  // ... existing validations
  if (!round.startDate) {
    error.value = `Round ${round.number} start date is required`
    return false
  }
  if (!round.endDate) {
    error.value = `Round ${round.number} end date is required`
    return false
  }
}
```

#### 2. HTML Required Attribute
Made date inputs required in the form:

```vue
<!-- app/pages/leagues/create.vue -->
<input
  v-model="round.startDate"
  type="date"
  class="input-field w-full"
  required    <!-- ✅ Added -->
/>

<input
  v-model="round.endDate"
  type="date"
  class="input-field w-full"
  required    <!-- ✅ Added -->
/>
```

#### 3. Data Sanitization (Defensive)
Convert empty strings to `null` before sending to API:

```javascript
// app/pages/leagues/create.vue - handleSubmit()
const sanitizedRounds = form.rounds.map(round => ({
  ...round,
  startDate: round.startDate || null,  // Empty string → null
  endDate: round.endDate || null        // Empty string → null
}))

await leaguesStore.createLeague({
  // ... other fields
  rounds: sanitizedRounds  // Use sanitized data
})
```

## Bug #5: Missing Membership Data in API Response

### Issue Description

After successfully creating the league and rounds, the store failed when trying to access the membership data:

```
Error creating league: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'joinedAt')
    at Proxy.createLeague (leagues.js:173:48)
```

### Root Cause

**API Response Mismatch**:
- **API Endpoint** (`server/api/leagues/create.post.ts`):
  - Created membership record (line 82)
  - Did NOT return membership in response (line 105)
  - Returned only: `{ success, message, data: { league, rounds } }`

- **Store** (`app/stores/leagues.js` line 173):
  - Expected: `response.data.membership.joinedAt`
  - Received: `response.data.membership` was `undefined`
  - Crashed when accessing `.joinedAt` on undefined

### User Impact
- League was successfully created in database
- But UI crashed before switching to new league
- User saw error instead of success
- Left in inconsistent state (league exists but not shown)

---

### Solution for Bug #5

Added `.returning()` to capture membership and included it in API response:

```typescript
// server/api/leagues/create.post.ts

// BEFORE (BROKEN)
await db.insert(leagueMemberships).values({
  leagueId: newLeague.id,
  userId: body.createdBy,
  role: 'owner',
  status: 'active'
})
// ❌ Membership not captured

return {
  success: true,
  data: {
    league: leagueWithRounds[0],
    rounds: leagueRounds
    // ❌ No membership
  }
}

// AFTER (FIXED)
const [newMembership] = await db.insert(leagueMemberships).values({
  leagueId: newLeague.id,
  userId: body.createdBy,
  role: 'owner',
  status: 'active'
}).returning()  // ✅ Capture the created membership

return {
  success: true,
  data: {
    league: leagueWithRounds[0],
    rounds: leagueRounds,
    membership: newMembership  // ✅ Include in response
  }
}
```

## Files Changed

### Bug #4 (Round Dates)
**File**: `app/pages/leagues/create.vue`

**Changes**:
1. Added round date validation (lines ~77-84)
2. Added `required` attribute to date inputs (lines ~324, ~332)
3. Added data sanitization in `handleSubmit()` (lines ~102-106)

### Bug #5 (Missing Membership)
**File**: `server/api/leagues/create.post.ts`

**Changes**:
1. Added `.returning()` to capture membership (line 82)
2. Stored result in `newMembership` variable (line 82)
3. Added `membership: newMembership` to response (line 109)

## Verification

### Testing Steps
1. ✅ Navigate to `/leagues/create`
2. ✅ Fill in league name and start date
3. ✅ Leave round dates empty initially → See validation error
4. ✅ Fill in round dates (start and end)
5. ✅ Click "Create League"
6. ✅ Verify successful creation
7. ✅ Verify redirect to dashboard
8. ✅ Verify league appears in LeagueSwitcher dropdown

### Database Validation
```sql
-- Check league was created
SELECT * FROM leagues ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Check rounds were created with valid dates
SELECT * FROM rounds WHERE leagueId = [newLeagueId];

-- Check membership was created with joinedAt timestamp
SELECT * FROM league_memberships WHERE leagueId = [newLeagueId];
```

### Code Quality
- ✅ Lint check passes: `npm run lint` (0 errors)
- ✅ All imports used
- ✅ Proper error handling maintained
- ✅ TypeScript types consistent

## Related Issues

This brings the total runtime bugs fixed to **5**:

1. ✅ **Bug #1**: `/api/leagues/my` 500 error - Auth/field naming issues
2. ✅ **Bug #2**: Create league 400 error - Parameter mismatch (userId → createdBy)
3. ✅ **Bug #3**: Delete league 500 error - Foreign key constraint violation
4. ✅ **Bug #4**: Create league DB error - Invalid date syntax (empty strings)
5. ✅ **Bug #5**: Create league crash - Missing membership in response

**Pattern Recognition**: 
- Bugs #2, #4, #5 all related to create league feature

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Shared Type Definitions
Create TypeScript interfaces for API contracts:

```typescript
// types/api.ts
export interface CreateLeagueRequest {
  createdBy: number
  name: string
  startDate: string
  endDate?: string | null
  rounds: Array<{
    number: number
    name: string
    pointLimit: number
    startDate: string      // Required, ISO date
    endDate: string        // Required, ISO date
  }>
}

export interface CreateLeagueResponse {
  success: boolean
  message: string
  data: {
    league: League
    rounds: Round[]
    membership: Membership  // Must include joinedAt
  }
}
```

### 2. Form Validation Library
Consider using a validation library like Zod:

```javascript
import { z } from 'zod'

const roundSchema = z.object({
  number: z.number().positive(),
  name: z.string().min(1),
  pointLimit: z.number().positive(),
  startDate: z.string().regex(/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/),  // ISO date
  endDate: z.string().regex(/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/)     // ISO date
})

const leagueSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1),
  startDate: z.string().regex(/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/),
  rounds: z.array(roundSchema).min(1)
})
```

### 3. API Response Validation
Validate API responses match expected shape:

```javascript
// In store
const response = await $fetch('/api/leagues/create', { ... })

if (!response.data.membership?.joinedAt) {
  throw new Error('Invalid API response: missing membership data')
}
```

### 4. End-to-End Testing
Add E2E tests for critical paths:

```javascript
// tests/e2e/create-league.spec.js
test('creates league with rounds', async () => {
  await page.goto('/leagues/create')
  await page.fill('[name="name"]', 'Test League')
  await page.fill('[name="startDate"]', '2025-01-01')
  await page.fill('[name="rounds[0].startDate"]', '2025-01-01')
  await page.fill('[name="rounds[0].endDate"]', '2025-01-31')
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]')
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard')
})
```

### 5. Database Constraints
Add constraints to prevent invalid data:

```sql
ALTER TABLE rounds 
  ADD CONSTRAINT rounds_dates_not_null 
  CHECK (startDate IS NOT NULL AND endDate IS NOT NULL);

ALTER TABLE rounds
  ADD CONSTRAINT rounds_dates_valid
  CHECK (endDate >= startDate);
```

## Status

**BOTH BUGS RESOLVED** ✅

The league creation form now:
- ✅ Requires all round dates (client-side validation)
- ✅ Sanitizes empty strings to null (defensive programming)
- ✅ Receives complete API response with membership data
- ✅ Successfully creates leagues and switches to them
- ✅ Redirects to dashboard on success

Ready for user testing of the complete create league flow.

## Additional Notes

### Why Rounds Need Dates

The rounds feature is designed to manage escalation campaigns with time-boxed phases. Each round represents a different points level (500, 1000, 1500, etc.) with a defined start and end date. This allows:

- Tournament organizers to schedule matches
- Players to know when armies are due
- System to track which round is currently active
- Automatic progression to next round on dates

Making dates required ensures the feature works as designed and prevents incomplete data.

### Why Membership Matters

The `membership` object includes:
- `joinedAt`: When user joined the league (needed for sorting/display)
- `role`: User's role in the league (owner, organizer, player)
- `status`: Active vs inactive membership

The store uses `joinedAt` to display "Joined [date]" in the UI and to sort leagues by recency. Without this data, the UI would be incomplete.
