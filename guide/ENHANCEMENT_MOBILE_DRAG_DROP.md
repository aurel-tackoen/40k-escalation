# Enhancement: Mobile Drag & Drop Support

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Component**: `ArmyListsView.vue`

---

## 🎯 Enhancement Overview

Improved the drag-and-drop experience on mobile devices by making the drag handle visible and adding clearer affordance for touch users.

---

## 🔍 Problem

The previous implementation had the drag handle hidden on mobile devices (`hidden md:flex`), which meant:
- ❌ Mobile users had no visual indication that units could be reordered
- ❌ The drag functionality technically worked but wasn't discoverable
- ❌ Touch users might not realize they could drag and drop units

---

## ✨ Solution

### 1. **Made Drag Handle Visible on Mobile**

**Before**:
```vue
<div class="hidden md:flex items-center justify-center flex-shrink-0">
  <div class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-300 transition-colors cursor-grab active:cursor-grabbing pr-2">
    <GripVertical :size="20" />
  </div>
</div>
```

**After**:
```vue
<div class="flex md:items-center md:justify-center flex-shrink-0">
  <div class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-300 transition-colors cursor-grab active:cursor-grabbing md:pr-2 flex items-center gap-2">
    <GripVertical :size="20" />
    <span class="text-xs text-gray-400 md:hidden">Drag to reorder</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Changes**:
- ✅ Removed `hidden` class - handle now visible on all screen sizes
- ✅ Added mobile-only helper text: "Drag to reorder"
- ✅ Adjusted spacing to work on both mobile and desktop
- ✅ Maintained desktop-only right padding

### 2. **Added Global Helper Text**

Added a persistent hint below the "Units" heading when 2+ units exist:

```vue
<p v-if="currentArmy.units.length >= 2" class="text-xs text-gray-400 mt-1 flex items-center gap-1">
  <GripVertical :size="14" />
  Drag units to reorder them
</p>
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Clear instruction visible to all users
- ✅ Only shows when reordering is actually possible (2+ units)
- ✅ Includes grip icon for visual consistency
- ✅ Doesn't clutter UI when not needed

## 📱 Mobile UX Improvements

### Visual Affordances
1. **Grip Icon**: ⋮⋮ visible on every unit card
2. **Helper Text**: "Drag to reorder" next to each grip icon
3. **Global Hint**: "Drag units to reorder them" below section header
4. **Touch Feedback**: Opacity changes and border highlights during drag

### Touch Interactions
- **Long press** on unit card or grip handle to start dragging
- **Drag** to desired position with visual feedback
- **Release** to drop at new position
- Same smooth reordering animation as desktop

---

## 🎨 Design Considerations

### Mobile Layout
- Grip handle appears at the top of each unit card
- Text "Drag to reorder" provides clear instruction
- Flexbox layout maintains proper spacing
- Icons and text align nicely on small screens

### Desktop Layout
- Grip handle maintains column-based positioning
- Helper text hidden (not needed on desktop)
- Right padding preserved for visual spacing
- No impact on existing desktop experience

### Progressive Enhancement
- Mobile users get explicit instructions
- Desktop users have familiar grip-only interface
- Both experiences are fully functional
- No breaking changes to existing behavior

---

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- ✅ Drag and drop works on mobile devices (iOS/Android)
- ✅ Helper text visible on mobile, hidden on desktop
- ✅ Global hint appears when 2+ units exist
- ✅ Visual feedback (borders, opacity) works on touch
- ✅ No layout shifts or overlapping elements
- ✅ Grip icon visible and properly sized on all screens
- ✅ No lint errors or warnings
- ✅ Backwards compatible with existing functionality

## 📊 Impact

### User Experience
- **Discoverability**: ⬆️⬆️⬆️ Significantly improved
- **Mobile Usability**: ⬆️⬆️ Much better
- **Clarity**: ⬆️⬆️ Clear instructions
- **Desktop Experience**: ➡️ Unchanged (as expected)

### Technical
- **Lines Changed**: ~10 lines
- **Performance**: No impact
- **Accessibility**: Improved (clearer affordances)
- **Maintenance**: Minimal (uses existing drag logic)

## 📝 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:
1. **Touch haptic feedback** on drag start/drop (mobile)
2. **Animated reordering transitions** for smoother visual flow
3. **Keyboard shortcuts** for reordering (accessibility)
4. **Drag preview customization** (show unit name during drag)
5. **Batch reordering** (select multiple units to move together)

## 🎉 Summary

This enhancement makes drag-and-drop functionality **discoverable and usable on mobile devices** without compromising the desktop experience. Mobile users now have clear visual cues and instructions for reordering units in their army lists.

**Key Wins**:
- ✅ Better mobile UX
- ✅ Clear affordances for touch users
- ✅ No desktop regression
- ✅ Minimal code changes
- ✅ Production ready
