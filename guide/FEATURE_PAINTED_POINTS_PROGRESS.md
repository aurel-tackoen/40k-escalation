# Painted Points Progress Tracking - Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready  
**Component**: `ArmyListsView.vue`

---

## 🎯 Feature Overview

Added painted points progress tracking alongside the existing model-based painting progress. This provides a more meaningful metric for tournament-ready armies where point value matters more than model count.

---

## 📊 What's New

### Dual Progress Bars

Each army and unit now displays **two** painting progress indicators:

1. **Models Painted** 🎨 - Original model count tracker
2. **Points Painted** 💰 - NEW point value tracker

---

## 🧮 Calculation Logic

### Unit Level

```javascript
// Points per model
pointsPerModel = unit.points / unit.totalModels

// Painted points
paintedPoints = pointsPerModel × unit.paintedModels

// Percentage
percentage = (paintedPoints / unit.points) × 100
```

**Example:**
- Tactical Squad: 10 models, 100 points
- Points per model: 10pts
- Painted: 7 models = 70 painted points (70%)

### Army Level

```javascript
// Total points (only units with models)
totalPoints = sum of all unit.points

// Total painted points
paintedPoints = sum of all unit painted points

// Percentage
percentage = (paintedPoints / totalPoints) × 100
```

## 🎨 Visual Implementation

### Army Card - Painting Progress Section

**Before** (single progress bar):
```
Painting Progress          75%
████████████░░░░  
15 / 20 models
```

**After** (dual progress bars):
```
Models Painted             75%
████████████░░░░  
15 / 20 models

Points Painted             82%
█████████████░░░  
164 / 200 pts
```

### Unit Cards - Individual Progress

Each unit now shows:
```
🎨 7 / 10 models           70%
████████████░░░░░░░

💰 70 / 100 pts            70%
████████████░░░░░░░
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### New Helper Functions (in component)

```javascript
// Calculate painted points for a unit
getUnitPaintedPoints(unit)
// Returns: number (rounded to nearest point)

// Calculate painted points percentage for a unit
getUnitPaintedPointsPercentage(unit)
// Returns: 0-100 percentage

// Calculate painted points stats for entire army
getArmyPaintedPoints(army)
// Returns: { totalPoints, paintedPoints, percentage }
```

### Key Features

1. **Smart Filtering**: Only counts units with models and points
2. **Rounding**: All values rounded to nearest integer
3. **Safety**: Handles edge cases (no models, zero points)
4. **Reuses Styling**: Uses existing `getPaintProgressClass()` and `getPaintPercentageColor()`

---

## 📍 Where It Appears

### 1. Army Cards (Saved Army Lists)
- **Location**: Main army list view
- **Display**: Two progress bars in painting section
- **Visibility**: Only shows if army has units with models

### 2. Unit Summary Cards
- **Location**: Within each army card
- **Display**: Two mini progress bars per unit
- **Visibility**: Only shows if unit has models tracked

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Why Points Matter More Than Models

1. **Tournament Ready**: Many events require specific point thresholds
2. **Unequal Model Values**: 
   - 5 Terminators (200pts) vs 20 Guardsmen (100pts)
   - Model % would be misleading
3. **Priority Painting**: Players can see which high-value units need attention
4. **Achievement Tracking**: "I've painted 500pts of my 1000pt army!"

### Example Scenario

**Army**: 1000 points
- HQ: Captain (1 model, 100pts) ✅ Painted
- Troops: 10 Tacticals (10 models, 100pts) ❌ Not painted
- Heavy: 3 Terminators (3 models, 150pts) ✅ Painted

**Model Progress**: 4/14 = 29% 🔴
**Points Progress**: 250/350 = 71% 🟢

Points progress gives a better picture of actual army readiness!

## 🎨 Color Coding (Consistent)

Both progress bars use the same color scheme:

| Percentage | Color | Meaning |
|------------|-------|---------|
| 100% | 🟣 Purple | Fully painted! |
| 71-99% | 🟢 Green | Battle ready |
| 31-70% | 🟡 Yellow | In progress |
| 0-30% | 🔴 Red | Just started |

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

- Desktop: Side-by-side or stacked (depending on space)
- Mobile: Stacked vertically for easy reading
- Both progress bars maintain full width
- Icons (🎨💰) help distinguish at a glance

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases Handled

✅ **Units with no models**: Progress bar hidden  
✅ **Units with zero points**: Skipped from army calculations  
✅ **Division by zero**: Returns 0% safely  
✅ **Partial models painted**: Calculates proportional points  
✅ **Rounding**: All values rounded to nearest integer  

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Leaderboard with points-based rankings
- [ ] Filter armies by painted points percentage
- [ ] Export painted points data to CSV
- [ ] Tournament-ready badge (e.g., "75%+ painted")
- [ ] Points painted vs models painted comparison chart

---

## ✅ Code Quality

- **Lint Status**: ✅ Zero errors
- **No External Dependencies**: Uses existing composables
- **Performance**: O(n) calculation per army (efficient)
- **Maintainability**: Clear function names and inline comments
- **Reusability**: Helper functions can be extracted to composable if needed

---

## 🚀 Usage

### For Users

1. **View Progress**: Check any saved army card
2. **See Dual Bars**: Models painted + Points painted
3. **Track Units**: Individual units show both metrics
4. **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded progress bars

### For Developers

```javascript
// Get unit painted points
const paintedPts = getUnitPaintedPoints(unit)

// Get unit percentage
const percentage = getUnitPaintedPointsPercentage(unit)

// Get army stats
const { totalPoints, paintedPoints, percentage } = getArmyPaintedPoints(army)
```

## 📈 Benefits

1. **Better Insight**: Points are more meaningful than model count
2. **Tournament Focus**: Aligns with competitive play requirements
3. **Motivation**: Shows real progress toward point goals
4. **Painting Priority**: Identify high-value unpainted units
5. **Professional Presentation**: Dual metrics show attention to detail
