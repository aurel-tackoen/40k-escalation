# üîê Netlify Identity Integration - Implementation Complete

## ‚úÖ Summary

**Complete user authentication system** has been successfully integrated into the Warhammer 40K Escalation League Manager using **Netlify Identity**.

**Implementation Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Production Ready

---

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates ‚úÖ
- **Modified `players` table** to include authentication fields:
  - `netlifyId` (varchar, unique) - Links to Netlify Identity user
  - `role` (varchar) - Role-based access control (player, organizer, admin)
  - `lastLogin` (timestamp) - Track user login activity
- **Migration applied:** `0004_cuddly_komodo.sql`
- **Players = Users** (unified model, no separate users table)

### 2. Client-Side Authentication ‚úÖ
**New Composable:** `app/composables/useAuth.js`
- Login/logout functionality
- User state management (reactive)
- Role checking (isAdmin, isOrganizer)
- JWT token handling
- Netlify Identity widget integration

### 3. Server-Side Security ‚úÖ
**New Utility:** `server/utils/auth.ts`
- `getCurrentUser()` - Extract user from JWT
- `requireAuth()` - Enforce authentication
- `requireRole()` - Role-based access control
- `ownsResource()` - Ownership validation
- `isAdmin()` / `isOrganizer()` - Role checks
- `updateLastLogin()` - Activity tracking

### 4. Authentication API Endpoints ‚úÖ
**New Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Create player profile after signup
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Update last login timestamp
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user info

### 5. Protected Existing Endpoints ‚úÖ
**Updated with Auth:**
- `POST /api/armies` - Requires auth + ownership check
- `DELETE /api/armies` - Requires auth + ownership check
- `POST /api/matches` - Requires auth + player/organizer check

**Authorization Rules:**
- Players can only manage **their own** armies
- Players can only record matches **they're involved in**
- Organizers can record **any match**
- Admins can do **everything**

### 6. UI Components ‚úÖ
**New Components:**
- `app/components/AuthModal.vue` - Login/signup modal
  - Warhammer-themed design
  - Netlify Identity widget integration
  - Mode switching (login/signup)

**Updated Components:**
- `app/layouts/default.vue` - Added auth navigation
  - Login/logout buttons
  - User info display (email)
  - Profile link
  - Mobile menu support

**New Pages:**
- `app/pages/profile.vue` - User profile management
  - Display user info and stats
  - Player registration form (if no profile)
  - Win/loss statistics
  - Battle points display

### 7. Documentation ‚úÖ
**New Guide:**
- `guide/NETLIFY_IDENTITY_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide
  - Architecture overview
  - Deployment steps
  - Authentication flow diagrams
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Security best practices
  - Testing instructions

## üöÄ Deployment Requirements

### Before Deploying:

1. **Enable Netlify Identity:**
   ```bash
   netlify addons:create identity
   ```

2. **Configure Identity Settings:**
   - Set registration to "Open" or "Invite only"
   - Enable email confirmations (optional)
   - Configure OAuth providers (optional)

3. **Apply Database Migration:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

4. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

5. **Test Authentication:**
   - Visit deployed site
   - Click "Login" in navigation
   - Sign up with email/password
   - Complete player profile
   - Test creating an army

---

## üîë Authentication Flow

### New User Registration
```
1. User clicks "Login" ‚Üí Netlify Identity widget opens
2. User signs up with email/password
3. Netlify creates account + issues JWT token
4. User redirected to /profile page
5. User fills out player info (name, faction)
6. POST /api/auth/register creates player in DB
7. netlifyId links user ‚Üî player
8. User can now create armies and record matches
```

### Returning User Login
```
1. User clicks "Login" ‚Üí Netlify Identity widget opens
2. User enters credentials
3. Netlify validates + issues JWT token
4. POST /api/auth/login updates lastLogin timestamp
5. User info displayed in navigation
6. User can access protected features
```

### API Request with Auth
```
1. Client gets JWT token from useAuth()
2. Client sends request with Authorization: Bearer <token>
3. Server extracts user from JWT (getCurrentUser)
4. Server checks permissions (requireAuth, ownsResource)
5. Server processes request or returns 401/403
```

## üîí Security Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- JWT-based authentication (managed by Netlify)
- Server-side token validation on all protected routes
- Ownership validation (users can only modify their own resources)
- Role-based access control (player, organizer, admin)
- Tokens stored in memory only (not localStorage)
- Automatic token expiration and refresh
- Protected API endpoints with clear error messages

### üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices Followed
- No passwords stored in database (managed by Netlify)
- All sensitive operations require authentication
- Ownership checks prevent unauthorized access
- Admins can bypass ownership for moderation
- Last login tracking for security audits

5. **View Stats** - Personal statistics on profile page

### For Organizers:
