## 🔄 Layout Updates

### `app/layouts/default.vue` - Enhanced Navigation
**Changes**:
1. ✅ Import `LeagueSwitcher` component
2. ✅ Import `useLeaguesStore`
3. ✅ Initialize leagues on mount: `await leaguesStore.initialize()`
4. ✅ Add "Leagues" tab to navigation

## ⚙️ ESLint Configuration Updates

### `eslint.config.ts` - Added Vue Composition API Globals
**Added Globals**:
```typescript
// Vue composition API
ref: "readonly",
reactive: "readonly",
computed: "readonly",
watch: "readonly",
watchEffect: "readonly",
toRef: "readonly",
toRefs: "readonly",
onUnmounted: "readonly",
useLeaguesStore: "readonly",  // Updated from useLeagueStore
```

**Why**: Nuxt auto-imports these from Vue, but ESLint needs to know they're globals to avoid "undefined" errors.
