## 🔥 Integration Details by Component

### 1. ArmyListsView.vue

**Composables Integrated:**
- ✅ `useArrayFiltering` (16 functions)
- ✅ `useDataExport` (7 functions)

**Changes Made:**
1. **Filtering Logic Simplified** (Lines Saved: ~15)
   - Replaced manual `if` statement filtering with `filterByMultipleCriteria()`
   - Replaced complex nested ternary sorting with `sortByField().sortByField()` chaining
   - Result: Cleaner, more maintainable code

2. **Export Functionality Added**
   - Added `exportArmies()` method using `formatForExport()` and `downloadCSV()`
   - Export includes: Player, Army Name, Round, Total Points, Status, Faction
   - Added Export CSV button with Download icon in header

**Before:**
```javascript
const filteredArmies = computed(() => {
  let filtered = props.armies
  if (filterRound.value) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(army => army.round === filterRound.value)
  }
  if (filterPlayer.value) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(army => army.playerId === filterPlayer.value)
  }
  return filtered.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a.round !== b.round) return a.round - b.round
    return getPlayerName(a.playerId).localeCompare(getPlayerName(b.playerId))
  })
})
```

**After:**
```javascript
const filteredArmies = computed(() => {
  const criteria = {}
  if (filterRound.value) criteria.round = filterRound.value
  if (filterPlayer.value) criteria.playerId = filterPlayer.value
  
  return filterByMultipleCriteria(props.armies, criteria)
    .sortByField('round')
    .sortByField(army => getPlayerName(army.playerId))
})
```
