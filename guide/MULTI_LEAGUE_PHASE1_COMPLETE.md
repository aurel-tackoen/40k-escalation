# Multi-League Refactor - Phase 1 Complete! üéâ

## What We Just Built

### 1. Database Schema Changes ‚úÖ

We've transformed the single-league architecture into a multi-league system:

**Updated Tables:**
- **`leagues`** - Now has ownership, privacy, and access control
  - `createdBy` ‚Üí Links to user who created league
  - `isPublic` ‚Üí Public or private league
  - `joinPassword` ‚Üí Hashed password for joining
  - `maxPlayers` ‚Üí Optional player limit
  - `status` ‚Üí League lifecycle ('active', 'completed', etc.)

- **`players`** - Now league-specific (Option A architecture)
  - `leagueId` ‚Üí Players belong to a specific league
  - Email no longer unique (users can join multiple leagues)
  - Stats scoped to league (wins/losses/draws per league)

- **`armies`** - League-scoped
  - `leagueId` ‚Üí Armies belong to a specific league

**New Table:**
- **`league_memberships`** - Junction table
  - Links users to leagues they've joined
  - Tracks role (owner/organizer/player)
  - Links to player entity
  - Tracks membership status (active/inactive)

### 2. Migration Scripts ‚úÖ

**Data Migration Script:** `/server/api/migrate-to-multileague.post.ts`
- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Creates default league if needed
- Migrates all existing players to the league
- Creates memberships for all users
- Sets first user as league owner
- Updates armies with league references

**Schema Migration:** `migrations/0006_jittery_prodigy.sql`
- Generated by Drizzle
- Applies all schema changes
- Adds new table and constraints

### 3. New API Endpoints ‚úÖ

**League Management:**
- `POST /api/leagues/create` - Create league with rounds and password
- `POST /api/leagues/:id/join` - Join league (with password verification)
- `POST /api/leagues/:id/leave` - Leave league (archives if owner is last member)
- `GET /api/leagues/my?userId=123` - Get all leagues user is member of

**Updated Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/players?leagueId=123` - Now league-scoped
- `POST /api/players` - Creates player in specific league + updates membership

### 4. Dependencies ‚úÖ

- Installed `bcryptjs` for secure password hashing

---

## How It Works

### User Journey
1. **User signs up** ‚Üí Gets user account
2. **Creates league** ‚Üí Becomes owner, creates password
3. **Others join** ‚Üí Enter password, become members
4. **Create player** ‚Üí Each user creates player profile in league
5. **Participate** ‚Üí Submit armies, record matches, all scoped to league
6. **Switch leagues** ‚Üí User can be member of multiple leagues

### Data Architecture

```
User (John)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ League Membership A (owner)
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Player "John" (5-2-1 record in League A)
  ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Army (500pts)
  ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Army (1000pts)
  ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Matches in League A
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ League Membership B (player)
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Player "JSmith" (3-1-0 record in League B)
          ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Army (500pts)
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Matches in League B
```

### Security
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- Role-based access (owner > organizer > player)
- League data isolation (can't see other league's data)
- Cascade deletes (delete league = delete all data)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate - Run Migration
```bash
# 1. Backup database first!
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup.sql

# 2. Run data migration
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/migrate-to-multileague

# 3. Apply schema migration
npm run db:migrate

# 4. Verify in Drizzle Studio
npm run db:studio
```

### Next Phase - Backend Completion
- Update remaining API endpoints (armies, matches)
- Add league settings endpoint
- Add member management endpoints
- Add middleware for auth/permissions

### Then - Frontend
- Refactor Pinia store for multi-league
- Create league list/create/join pages
- Add league switcher to navigation
- Update all components to use league context

---

## Testing the APIs

### Create a League
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/leagues/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Spring Escalation 2025",
    "description": "Progressive escalation league",
    "startDate": "2025-03-01",
    "createdBy": 1,
    "isPublic": true,
    "joinPassword": "warhammer40k",
    "maxPlayers": 20,
    "rounds": [
      {
        "number": 1,
        "name": "500 Points",
        "pointLimit": 500,
        "startDate": "2025-03-01",
        "endDate": "2025-03-14"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Join a League
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/leagues/1/join \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": 2,
    "password": "warhammer40k"
  }'
```

### Get My Leagues
```bash
curl http://localhost:8888/api/leagues/my?userId=1
```

### Create Player in League
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/players \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "leagueId": 1,
    "userId": 1,
    "name": "Commander Farsight",
    "email": "farsight@tau.empire",
    "faction": "Tau Empire"
  }'
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Option A (League-Specific Players)?
‚úÖ **Simplest to implement** - Existing schema mostly works  
‚úÖ **Natural data scoping** - Stats automatically scoped to league  
‚úÖ **Flexible** - Users can have different names/factions per league  
‚úÖ **Clean queries** - Just filter by leagueId  

### Why Cascade Deletes?
‚úÖ **Data integrity** - No orphaned records  
‚úÖ **Cleaner** - Automatically cleanup related data  
‚úÖ **Safe** - Owner can't accidentally leave (checks for other members)

### Why Password Hashing?
‚úÖ **Security** - Passwords never stored in plaintext  
‚úÖ **Standard** - Industry best practice  
‚úÖ **Flexible** - Can add password requirements later

## Breaking Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è

### API Changes
- `GET /api/players` now requires `?leagueId=123` (or returns all for admin)
- `POST /api/players` now requires `leagueId` in request body
- Players no longer have unique emails (same email can exist in multiple leagues)

### Database Changes
- `players.leagueId` now required
- `players.email` no longer unique
- New `league_memberships` table
- `leagues` requires `createdBy`
- `armies` requires `leagueId`

### Frontend Impact
- All components need league context
- Routes will change (add league prefix)
- Store structure completely different
- Need league switcher UI
