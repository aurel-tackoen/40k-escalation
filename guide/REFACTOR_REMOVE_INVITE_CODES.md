# Refactor: Removed Invite Code Functionality

## Overview
Removed the invite code functionality entirely, keeping only the share link method for joining private leagues. This simplifies the user experience by providing a single, streamlined way to invite players.

## Changes Made

### 1. LeagueSetupView.vue

**Removed Icons:**
```javascript
// Before
import { Save, Plus, Trash2, Settings as SettingsIcon, Share2, Copy, RefreshCw, Link, Globe, Lock, RotateCcw, AlertTriangle } from 'lucide-vue-next'

// After  
import { Save, Plus, Trash2, Settings as SettingsIcon, Share2, Copy, RefreshCw, Link, Globe, Lock, AlertTriangle } from 'lucide-vue-next'
```
Removed: `RotateCcw` (used for regenerate button)

**Removed Reactive State:**
```javascript
// Removed
const inviteCodeCopied = ref(false)
```

**Removed Functions:**
- `generateInviteCode()` - Generated random 8-character codes
- `regenerateInviteCode()` - Regenerated and saved new invite codes
- `copyInviteCode()` - Copied invite code to clipboard

**Removed Logic from onMounted:**
```javascript
// Removed auto-generation of invite codes
if (editableLeague.value?.isPrivate && !editableLeague.value.inviteCode) {
  const newCode = generateInviteCode()
  editableLeague.value.inviteCode = newCode
  // ... save to database
}
```

**Removed Watcher:**
```javascript
// Removed watcher for isPrivate changes
watch(() => editableLeague.value?.isPrivate, async (newValue, oldValue) => {
  // Auto-generated invite code when toggling private on
})
```

**Removed Template Section:**
```vue
<!-- Removed entire "Invite Code (Alternative)" section -->
<div class="border-t border-gray-700 pt-6">
  <h4>Invite Code (Alternative)</h4>
  <!-- Regenerate button -->
  <!-- Code display -->
  <!-- Copy button -->
</div>
```

### 2. LeagueSwitcher.vue

**Removed Icons:**
```javascript
// Before
import { Swords, ChevronDown, Check, Plus, LogIn, Crown, Settings, Target, Key, Globe, Lock } from 'lucide-vue-next'

// After
import { Swords, ChevronDown, Check, Plus, LogIn, Crown, Settings, Target, Globe, Lock } from 'lucide-vue-next'
```
Removed: `Key` (used for join private league icon)

**Removed Imports:**
```javascript
// Removed
import { useAuthStore } from '~/stores/auth'
const authStore = useAuthStore()
```
No longer needed since invite code joining functionality removed.

**Removed Reactive State:**
```javascript
// Removed
const showJoinPrivate = ref(false)
const inviteCode = ref('')
const isJoining = ref(false)
```

**Removed Function:**
```javascript
// Removed entire joinWithInviteCode function
const joinWithInviteCode = async () => {
  // Validation
  // Authentication check
  // API call to /api/leagues/join-by-code
  // Error handling
  // Success handling
}
```

**Removed Template Section:**
```vue
<!-- Removed "Join Private League" dropdown section -->
<div class="border-t border-gray-700">
  <button @click="showJoinPrivate = !showJoinPrivate">
    <Key />
    Join Private League
  </button>
  
  <div v-if="showJoinPrivate">
    <input v-model="inviteCode" placeholder="Enter invite code" />
    <button @click="joinWithInviteCode">Join League</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

## What Remains (Share Link Only)

### League Setup
- **Public/Private Toggle** - Still available
- **Allow Direct Join Checkbox** - For private leagues
- **Share Link Generator** - Creates unique shareable URLs
- **Copy Share Link** - Copies URL to clipboard
- **Share Instructions** - Guide for using share links

### League Switcher
- **My Leagues List** - View all joined leagues
- **Create League** - Link to create new league
- **Join League** - Link to browse public leagues
- ❌ **Join Private League** - Removed (now via share links only)

## User Flow Changes

### Before (Two Methods)
**Method 1: Invite Code**
1. Owner generates 8-character code in settings
2. Owner shares code via message/email
3. Player opens LeagueSwitcher dropdown
4. Player clicks "Join Private League"
5. Player manually types 8-character code
6. Player clicks "Join League"

**Method 2: Share Link**
1. Owner generates share URL in settings
2. Owner shares URL via message/email
3. Player clicks URL
4. Player automatically joins league

### After (One Method Only)
**Share Link Only:**
1. Owner generates share URL in settings
2. Owner shares URL via message/email/social
3. Player clicks URL
4. Player automatically joins league

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Simpler user experience (one method instead of two)
- ✅ Fewer clicks required (click link vs open dropdown + type code)
- ✅ No manual typing (prevents typos)
- ✅ Better for mobile users (no need to type codes)
- ✅ More shareable (works in emails, messages, social media)
- ✅ Less code to maintain

## Database Impact

### Tables Still Used
- `leagues.shareToken` - Still used for share links
- `leagues.allowDirectJoin` - Still controls share link access
- `leagues.isPrivate` - Still determines visibility

### Tables No Longer Used
- `leagues.inviteCode` - ⚠️ Field still exists in schema but no longer generated or used
  - **Recommendation**: Can be deprecated in future migration
  - Not removing now to avoid breaking existing data

## API Endpoints Impact

### Still Used
- ✅ `POST /api/leagues/:id/share-url` - Generate share tokens
- ✅ `GET /api/leagues/join/:token` - Join via share link (if exists)

### No Longer Used
- ❌ `POST /api/leagues/join-by-code` - Join via invite code
  - **Recommendation**: Can be deprecated in future

## Migration Path for Existing Users

### Existing Private Leagues
- Share links can be generated for any private league
- Old invite codes in database still exist but not displayed
- No data migration required
- Owners should regenerate share links for new invites

### Existing Invite Codes
- Codes stored in database remain unchanged
- Frontend no longer displays or accepts them
- Backend endpoint still exists but unused
- Can be safely deprecated in future

## Files Modified

### Primary Changes
- ✅ `/app/components/views/LeagueSetupView.vue`
  - Removed invite code generation UI
  - Removed invite code functions
  - Removed invite code watchers
  - Kept share link functionality

- ✅ `/app/components/LeagueSwitcher.vue`
  - Removed "Join Private League" dropdown
  - Removed invite code input
  - Removed join-by-code function
  - Kept public league discovery link

### Files Not Modified (Future Cleanup)
- `/server/api/leagues/join-by-code.post.ts` - Can be deprecated later
- `/db/schema.ts` - `inviteCode` field can be removed later
- `AGENTS.md` - References to invite codes can be updated later

## Testing Checklist

## Future Cleanup (Optional)

```
