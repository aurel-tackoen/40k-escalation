# Multi-League Refactor - Implementation Status

**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Status**: üü° In Progress (Phase 1 Complete + Database Setup Complete)

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 0: Database Environment Setup (COMPLETE)

### Local Development Configuration
- ‚úÖ Updated `db/index.ts` - Supports both DATABASE_URL (local) and NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL (production)
- ‚úÖ Updated `drizzle.config.ts` - Dual environment support
- ‚úÖ Updated `.env` - Configured for local Neon branch with correct ports (8888)
- ‚úÖ Updated `.env.example` - Added database configuration template
- ‚úÖ Created `guide/DATABASE_LOCAL_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide
- ‚úÖ Created `guide/DATABASE_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md` - Quick setup checklist

### Database Branch Strategy
- **Local Development**: Uses dedicated `local` branch via `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`
- **Production**: Uses main branch via `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` (auto-set by Netlify)
- Changes to local branch don't affect production
- Safe to test migrations and data changes locally

### Next Step
- ‚è≥ **TODO**: Run migrations on local branch (`npm run db:migrate`)

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Database Schema (COMPLETE)

### Database Changes
- ‚úÖ Updated `leagues` table with ownership columns:
  - `createdBy` (FK to users.id) - League owner
  - `isPublic` (boolean) - Public vs private
  - `joinPassword` (varchar) - Hashed password
  - `maxPlayers` (integer) - Optional limit
  - `status` (varchar) - 'draft', 'active', 'completed', 'archived'

- ‚úÖ Updated `players` table to be league-specific:
  - `leagueId` (FK to leagues.id, NOT NULL, CASCADE DELETE)
  - Removed unique constraint on `email` (users can have multiple players)
  - Stats (wins, losses, draws, totalPoints) now scoped to league

- ‚úÖ Updated `armies` table:
  - `leagueId` (FK to leagues.id, NOT NULL, CASCADE DELETE)

- ‚úÖ Created `league_memberships` table:
  - Junction table linking users to leagues
  - Tracks role ('owner', 'organizer', 'player')
  - Links to player entity via `playerId`
  - Status tracking ('active', 'inactive', 'banned')

### Migration
- ‚úÖ Generated migration: `0006_jittery_prodigy.sql`
- ‚úÖ Created data migration script: `/api/migrate-to-multileague`
- ‚è≥ **TODO**: Run migration scripts

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 2: Backend API (PARTIAL)

### New Endpoints Created
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/leagues/create` - Create league with rounds
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/leagues/:id/join` - Join league with password
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/leagues/:id/leave` - Leave league
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/leagues/my` - Get user's leagues
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/migrate-to-multileague` - Data migration script

### Updated Endpoints
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/players?leagueId=123` - Now league-scoped
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/players` - Creates player in specific league + links membership

### Endpoints Still TODO
- ‚è≥ `GET /api/armies?leagueId=123` - Filter by league
- ‚è≥ `POST /api/armies` - Add leagueId validation
- ‚è≥ `GET /api/matches?leagueId=123` - Filter by league
- ‚è≥ `POST /api/matches` - Add leagueId validation
- ‚è≥ `GET /api/leagues/:id` - Get single league with full data
- ‚è≥ `PATCH /api/leagues/:id` - Update league settings (owner only)
- ‚è≥ `DELETE /api/leagues/:id` - Delete league (owner only)
- ‚è≥ `GET /api/leagues/:id/members` - List members
- ‚è≥ `PATCH /api/leagues/:id/members/:userId/role` - Update member role

### Dependencies
- ‚úÖ Installed `bcryptjs` for password hashing

---

## ‚è≥ Phase 3: Frontend State Management (TODO)

### Pinia Store Refactor
- ‚è≥ Rename `league.js` to `leagues.js` (plural)
- ‚è≥ Update state structure:
  ```javascript
  state: {
    myLeagues: [],           // User's leagues
    currentLeagueId: null,   // Active league
    leagues: {},             // Map of league data
    players: [],             // Scoped to current league
    matches: [],             // Scoped to current league
    armies: []               // Scoped to current league
  }
  ```
- ‚è≥ Add getters:
  - `currentLeague` - Get active league
  - `myRole` - Get user's role in current league
  - `canEditLeague` - Permission check
  - `isOwner` - Permission check
- ‚è≥ Update actions:
  - `createLeague(leagueData, password)`
  - `joinLeague(leagueId, password)`
  - `leaveLeague(leagueId)`
  - `switchLeague(leagueId)`
  - `fetchMyLeagues()`
  - All existing actions need leagueId parameter

---

## ‚è≥ Phase 4: Frontend UI (TODO)

### New Pages Needed
- ‚è≥ `/leagues` - List user's leagues
- ‚è≥ `/leagues/create` - Create new league form
- ‚è≥ `/leagues/join` - Join league form
- ‚è≥ `/leagues/:id/settings` - League settings (owner/organizer)
- ‚è≥ `/leagues/:id/members` - Member management

### Route Changes
- ‚è≥ Update routes from:
  - `/dashboard` ‚Üí `/leagues/:id/dashboard`
  - `/players` ‚Üí `/leagues/:id/players`
  - `/armies` ‚Üí `/leagues/:id/armies`
  - `/matches` ‚Üí `/leagues/:id/matches`
  - `/setup` ‚Üí `/leagues/:id/setup`

### Layout Updates
- ‚è≥ Add league switcher dropdown to navigation
- ‚è≥ Add "Create League" button
- ‚è≥ Add "Join League" button
- ‚è≥ Show current league name in header
- ‚è≥ Show user's role badge (Owner/Organizer/Player)

### Component Updates
- ‚è≥ Update all components to use scoped data (via currentLeagueId)
- ‚è≥ Add permission-based UI elements:
  - Show/hide edit buttons based on role
  - Disable actions for non-owners
- ‚è≥ Update forms to include leagueId

---

## üìã Migration Checklist

### Before Running Migration
- ‚è≥ **BACKUP DATABASE** - Critical!
- ‚è≥ Test migration script on copy of production data
- ‚è≥ Verify all users have user IDs
- ‚è≥ Verify at least one user exists to be league owner

### Migration Steps
1. ‚è≥ Run data migration: `POST /api/migrate-to-multileague`
   - Creates default league if needed
   - Assigns all players to league
   - Creates memberships
   - Sets first user as owner
   - Updates armies with leagueId

2. ‚è≥ Apply database migration: `npm run db:migrate`
   - Applies schema changes
   - Makes leagueId NOT NULL
   - Creates new table

3. ‚è≥ Verify migration:
   - Check all players have leagueId
   - Check league has createdBy
   - Check memberships created
   - Check armies have leagueId

---

## üö® Breaking Changes

### API Changes
- ‚ùó `GET /api/players` now requires `?leagueId=123` parameter
- ‚ùó `POST /api/players` now requires `leagueId` in body
- ‚ùó All player queries will be scoped to leagues
- ‚ùó Email uniqueness removed from players (same user can join multiple leagues)

### Frontend Changes
- ‚ùó Store structure completely changed
- ‚ùó Routes will change (add `/leagues/:id` prefix)
- ‚ùó Components need league context everywhere

---

## üéØ Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Do Next)
1. **Run Migration**:
   ```bash
   # Step 1: Data migration
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/migrate-to-multileague
   
   # Step 2: Apply schema migration
   npm run db:migrate
   
   # Step 3: Verify
   npm run db:studio
   ```

2. **Update Remaining Endpoints**:
   - Update armies GET/POST endpoints
   - Update matches GET/POST endpoints
   - Test all endpoints with leagueId parameter

3. **Refactor Pinia Store**:

## üìä Architecture Decisions Made

### ‚úÖ Player Architecture: Option A (League-Specific Players)
**Decision**: Players are league-specific entities with stats scoped to each league.

**Why**:
- Simplest to implement
- Natural data scoping
- Stats automatically scoped
- Minimal migration complexity

**Trade-offs**:
- More player records in DB
- No global stats (can add later)
- User can have multiple "identities" across leagues

### ‚úÖ Password Security
- Using bcryptjs for hashing
- Passwords stored hashed in database
- Compare on join attempt
- Support for passwordless public leagues

### ‚úÖ Cascade Deletes
- Delete league ‚Üí cascade to all dependent data
- Keeps database clean
- Owner leaving = archive league (don't delete)

---

## üîß Technical Notes

### Database Constraints
- `players.leagueId` - NOT NULL, CASCADE DELETE
- `armies.leagueId` - NOT NULL, CASCADE DELETE
- `leagues.createdBy` - NOT NULL (after migration)
- `league_memberships` - Unique per (userId, leagueId)

### Role Hierarchy
1. `owner` - Full control
2. `organizer` - Can manage, can't delete
3. `player` - Can participate, limited edit

### League Status Flow
- `draft` ‚Üí `active` ‚Üí `completed` ‚Üí `archived`
- Active leagues accept new members
- Completed leagues are read-only
- Archived leagues are hidden from UI
