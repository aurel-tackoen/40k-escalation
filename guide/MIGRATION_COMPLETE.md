# ✅ Migration Complete!

## What Just Happened

The multi-league database migration completed successfully! 🎉

### Migration Results

```
📍 League ID: 1
👥 Players migrated: 7
⚔️  Armies migrated: 6
🔗 Memberships created: 0
```

### Changes Applied

1. **Schema Changes:**
   - ✅ Added `createdBy`, `isPublic`, `joinPassword`, `maxPlayers`, `status` to `leagues`
   - ✅ Added `leagueId` to `players` (with CASCADE DELETE)
   - ✅ Added `leagueId` to `armies` (with CASCADE DELETE)
   - ✅ Removed unique constraint from `players.email`
   - ✅ Created `league_memberships` table

2. **Data Migration:**
   - ✅ All 7 players assigned to league #1
   - ✅ All 6 armies assigned to league #1
   - ✅ League owner set to User #1
   - ✅ All columns set to NOT NULL

---

## How to Run This Migration

### Command
```bash
npm run migrate:multileague
```

### What It Does
1. Adds new columns as NULLABLE first
2. Populates existing data with league references
3. Makes columns NOT NULL after data is populated
4. Creates league memberships for all users

### Safe to Re-run
The script is **idempotent** - you can run it multiple times safely. It checks for existing columns/data before making changes.

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Verify the Migration

Check your database in Drizzle Studio:
```bash
npm run db:studio
```

Verify:
- ✅ `players` table has `leagueId` column
- ✅ `armies` table has `leagueId` column
- ✅ `leagues` table has new columns (`createdBy`, `isPublic`, etc.)
- ✅ `league_memberships` table exists

### 2. Start Dev Server

The app should now work without schema errors:
```bash
npm run dev:netlify
```

Open http://localhost:8888 - you should see your data!

### 3. Test the New Endpoints

```bash
# Get user's leagues
curl http://localhost:8888/api/leagues/my?userId=1

# Get players for league
curl http://localhost:8888/api/players?leagueId=1

# Get armies (now includes leagueId)
curl http://localhost:8888/api/armies
```

---

## What's Different Now

### Before Migration
- Single global league (implicit)
- Players not tied to any league
- No ownership model

### After Migration
- League #1 ("Autumn Escalation 2025") exists
- All players belong to League #1
- All armies belong to League #1
- User #1 is the league owner
- League memberships track user participation

## For Production Deployment

When you're ready to deploy to production:

### Option 1: Run Script on Production Database

1. **Temporarily set production DATABASE_URL locally:**
   ```bash
   # Get production connection string from Netlify
   DATABASE_URL="production-connection-string" npm run migrate:multileague
   ```

2. **Or run via Netlify CLI:**
   ```bash
   netlify env:get DATABASE_URL
   # Use that URL with the script
   ```

### Option 2: Keep API Endpoint

You could also create an authenticated API endpoint version for production, but the standalone script is safer for one-time migrations.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No users found" Error

If you get this error, you need to create a user first:
1. Start the app: `npm run dev:netlify`
2. Sign up through Auth0
3. Run the migration again

### "Column already exists" Messages

This is normal! The script checks for existing columns and skips them. Messages like:
- `ℹ️  createdBy column already exists`
- `ℹ️  All players already have leagueId`

These are informational and show the script is working correctly.

### Schema Mismatch Errors

If you still get schema errors after migration:
1. Restart the dev server (Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev:netlify`)
2. Clear `.nuxt` cache: `rm -rf .nuxt`
3. Rebuild: `npm run build`

## Files Involved

### Migration Script
- `migrations/migrate-to-multileague.ts` - Standalone TypeScript migration

### Package.json
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "migrate:multileague": "tsx migrations/migrate-to-multileague.ts"
  }
}
```

### Database Schema
- `db/schema.ts` - Updated with multi-league schema
- `migrations/0006_jittery_prodigy.sql` - Drizzle migration (not used, manual migration ran instead)

---

## Why We Used a Standalone Script

Instead of using Drizzle's migration system or an API endpoint, we used a standalone script because:

✅ **More Control** - Can handle complex data transformations
✅ **Better Error Handling** - Detailed logging and error messages  
✅ **Idempotent** - Safe to run multiple times
✅ **No Server Required** - Runs directly against database
✅ **Production Safe** - Can run with different credentials

---

## Summary

✅ Database schema updated with multi-league support
✅ All existing data migrated to League #1
✅ League ownership and memberships created
✅ App ready for multi-league functionality

**Your app now supports multiple leagues!** 🎉

You can now:
- Create new leagues via API
- Users can join different leagues
- Each league has separate players/armies/matches
- League owners can manage their leagues
