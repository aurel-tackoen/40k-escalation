## 🚀 User Experience Improvements

### Before: Browser Alerts
- ❌ Blocking modal dialogs
- ❌ No visual distinction between success/error
- ❌ Requires user click to dismiss
- ❌ Interrupts workflow
- ❌ No stacking for multiple messages
- ❌ Generic browser styling

### After: Toast Notifications
- ✅ Non-blocking notifications
- ✅ Color-coded by type (green/red/yellow/blue)
- ✅ Auto-dismiss after 3-5 seconds
- ✅ Manual dismiss option
- ✅ Stacking for multiple toasts
- ✅ Smooth slide-in/fade-out animations
- ✅ Warhammer 40k themed styling
- ✅ Icon indicators for quick recognition
- ✅ Backdrop blur for modern look

## 📱 Toast Behavior

### Duration Defaults
- **Success**: 3 seconds
- **Error**: 5 seconds (users need more time to read errors)
- **Warning**: 4 seconds
- **Info**: 3 seconds

### Positioning
- **Location**: Fixed top-right corner
- **Stacking**: Vertical stack with 8px gap
- **Max Width**: 384px (24rem)
- **Z-Index**: 50 (above all content)

### Animations
```css
Enter: translateX(100%) → translateX(0) + opacity 0 → 1
Leave: translateX(100%) + scale(0.9) + opacity 1 → 0
Duration: 300ms ease
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Composable Pattern
```javascript
// Centralized state management
const toasts = ref([])

// Clear, descriptive function names
const { toastSuccess, toastError, toastWarning, toastInfo } = useToast()

// Simple usage
toastSuccess('Operation completed!')
```

### Component Integration
```vue
<script setup>
import { useToast } from '~/composables/useToast'

const { toastSuccess, toastError } = useToast()

const saveData = async () => {
  try {
    await $fetch('/api/save')
    toastSuccess('Data saved!')
  } catch (error) {
    toastError('Save failed')
  }
}
</script>
```
