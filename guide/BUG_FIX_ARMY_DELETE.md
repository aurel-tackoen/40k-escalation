# Bug Fix: Army Delete Not Working

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Severity**: High (Core functionality broken)

## Problem

Users were unable to delete armies. When clicking the delete button and confirming deletion, nothing happened - the army remained in the list.

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: Missing League ID in Delete Operation

The `armies` table has a composite key that includes `leagueId`, `playerId`, and `round`. However, the delete operation was only using `playerId` and `round`, which:
- Could fail to find the correct army in multi-league scenarios
- Violated the database schema's intent for league-specific data
- Could potentially delete the wrong army if a player had the same round in different leagues

### Issue 2: Broken Confirmation Composable

The `useConfirmation` composable had a design flaw where:
- It accepted a `defaultCallback` parameter during initialization
- The callback was stored in a ref that got cleared on `cancel()`
- This meant the default callback was lost after the first use
- Components passing callbacks during initialization had non-functional delete buttons

## Solution

### Fix 1: Add League ID to Delete Operations

**File**: `app/stores/leagues.js`
```javascript
// BEFORE
async deleteArmy(playerId, round) {
  const response = await $fetch(`/api/armies?playerId=${playerId}&round=${round}`, {
    method: 'DELETE'
  })
  if (response.success) {
    this.armies = this.armies.filter(a =>
      !(a.playerId === playerId && a.round === round)
    )
  }
}

// AFTER
async deleteArmy(playerId, round) {
  if (!this.currentLeagueId) {
    throw new Error('No league selected')
  }

  const response = await $fetch(`/api/armies?leagueId=${this.currentLeagueId}&playerId=${playerId}&round=${round}`, {
    method: 'DELETE'
  })
  if (response.success) {
    this.armies = this.armies.filter(a =>
      !(a.playerId === playerId && a.round === round && a.leagueId === this.currentLeagueId)
    )
  }
}
```

**File**: `server/api/armies.delete.ts`
```typescript
// BEFORE
const playerId = parseInt(query.playerId as string)
const round = parseInt(query.round as string)

const deleted = await db.delete(armies)
  .where(
    and(
      eq(armies.playerId, playerId),
      eq(armies.round, round)
    )
  )

// AFTER
const leagueId = parseInt(query.leagueId as string)
const playerId = parseInt(query.playerId as string)
const round = parseInt(query.round as string)

if (!leagueId || isNaN(leagueId) || !playerId || isNaN(playerId) || !round || isNaN(round)) {
  throw createError({
    statusCode: 400,
    statusMessage: 'Valid league ID, player ID and round are required'
  })
}

const deleted = await db.delete(armies)
  .where(
    and(
      eq(armies.leagueId, leagueId),
      eq(armies.playerId, playerId),
      eq(armies.round, round)
    )
  )
```

### Fix 2: Improve Confirmation Composable

**File**: `app/composables/useConfirmation.js`

**Changes**:
1. Accept `defaultCallback` as a parameter (stored in closure, not ref)
2. Modified `execute()` to use fallback chain: `callbackOverride || confirmCallback.value || defaultCallback`
3. This ensures the default callback persists across multiple uses

```javascript
// BEFORE
export function useConfirmation() {
  const item = ref(null)
  const isOpen = ref(false)
  const confirmCallback = ref(null)
  
  const execute = (defaultCallback = null) => {
    const callback = confirmCallback.value || defaultCallback
    // ...
  }
}

// AFTER
export function useConfirmation(defaultCallback = null) {
  const item = ref(null)
  const isOpen = ref(false)
  const confirmCallback = ref(null)
  
  const execute = (callbackOverride = null) => {
    const callback = callbackOverride || confirmCallback.value || defaultCallback
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Manual Test Steps
1. Navigate to the Army Lists page
2. Create an army for a player in a round
3. Click the delete (trash) icon on the army
4. Confirm deletion in the modal
5. ✅ Army should be removed from the list
6. ✅ Check database to ensure army is deleted

### Edge Cases Covered
- ✅ Deleting armies in multi-league scenarios
- ✅ Deleting armies when user is a player (not organizer)
- ✅ Deleting armies when user is an organizer
- ✅ Multiple delete operations without page reload

## Files Modified

1. `app/stores/leagues.js` - Added `leagueId` to delete operation
2. `server/api/armies.delete.ts` - Required `leagueId` in API endpoint
3. `app/composables/useConfirmation.js` - Fixed default callback persistence

## Database Impact

No schema changes required. The fix properly uses the existing composite key:
- `leagueId` (integer, FK to leagues.id)
- `playerId` (integer, FK to players.id)
- `round` (integer)

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible** - no breaking changes to component API or database schema.

## Related Issues

This fix ensures:
- League isolation (armies can't be accidentally deleted from wrong league)
- Proper confirmation flow works for all deletion operations
- Consistent behavior across all components using `useConfirmation`

## Code Quality

- ✅ Zero lint errors
- ✅ Follows existing code patterns
- ✅ Maintains composable reusability
- ✅ Proper error handling
