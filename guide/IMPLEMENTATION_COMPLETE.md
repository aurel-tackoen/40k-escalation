# ✅ Database Match Type Implementation - COMPLETE

## Summary

Successfully implemented **game-specific match types** stored in the database with a unified seed endpoint.

## What Was Done

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- ✅ Added `matchType`, `description`, `matchConfig` to `game_systems` table
- ✅ Migration `0016_secret_war_machine.sql` created and applied

### 2. Game Systems Seed Endpoint
- ✅ Updated `/api/seed-game-systems` endpoint
- ✅ Seeds in order:
  1. Game systems (with matchType & matchConfig)
  2. Factions
  3. Missions
  4. Unit types
- ✅ Updates existing game systems with new fields (idempotent)

### 3. API Updates
- ✅ `GET /api/game-systems` - Returns matchType and parsed matchConfig
- ✅ `POST /api/seed-game-systems` - Seeds game systems, factions, missions, unit types

### 4. Data Flow
```
app/data/game-systems.js (source)
    ↓
POST /api/seed-game-systems (writes to DB with matchType & matchConfig)
    ↓
PostgreSQL game_systems table
    ↓
GET /api/game-systems (reads & parses JSON)
    ↓
Pinia store (gameSystems array)
    ↓
MatchesView (currentGameSystem.matchType)
    ↓
Conditional forms render based on matchType
```

## How to Test

### 1. Apply Migration
```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

### 2. Seed Database
Start dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

In another terminal or browser:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/seed-game-systems
```

Expected output:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Game systems seeded successfully",
  "data": {
    "gameSystemsCreated": 5,
    "factionsCreated": 139,
    "missionsCreated": 69,
    "unitTypesCreated": 43
  }
}
```

### 3. Verify Game Systems
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/game-systems
```

Should return 5 game systems with `matchType` and `matchConfig` fields.

### 4. Test in UI
1. Go to `/matches` page
2. You should see the **Victory Points** form (if your league uses 40k)
3. Try creating a league with "The Old World" → should see **Percentage/Casualties** form
4. Try creating a league with "MESBG" → should see **Scenario Objectives** form

> **Note**: You'll need to create leagues manually through the UI. The seed endpoint only sets up game systems, not test data.

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `db/schema.ts` - Added 3 fields to game_systems
2. ✅ `migrations/0016_secret_war_machine.sql` - Migration
3. ✅ `server/api/seed-game-systems.post.ts` - Seeds game systems with new fields
4. ✅ `server/api/game-systems.get.ts` - Simplified (parses matchConfig JSON)
5. ✅ `server/api/seed.post.ts` - **REMOVED** (no test data seeding)
6. ✅ `guide/DATABASE_MATCH_TYPE_UPDATE.md` - Updated instructions
7. ✅ `AGENTS.md` - Updated schema documentation

## Next Steps

- [ ] Run `POST /api/seed-game-systems` to populate game systems
- [ ] Create a league through the UI
- [ ] Test recording matches with different game systems
- [ ] Verify conditional forms appear based on game system
- [ ] Test backward compatibility with existing matches

## Match Types Reference

| Game System | Match Type | Form Fields |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Warhammer 40k | `victory_points` | VP (0-100) |
| Age of Sigmar | `victory_points` | VP (0-100) |
| The Horus Heresy | `victory_points` | VP (0-100) |
| The Old World | `percentage` | Army values, casualties, margin |
| MESBG | `scenario` | Objective, completion, casualties |
