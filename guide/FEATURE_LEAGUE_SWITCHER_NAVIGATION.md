# Feature: League Switcher Navigation to Dashboard

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview

Added automatic navigation to the dashboard when switching leagues via the LeagueSwitcher component in the navigation bar.

## Problem

When users clicked on a league in the LeagueSwitcher dropdown:
- The league was switched successfully (store updated)
- But the user remained on whatever page they were currently on
- This was confusing because they expected to see the dashboard for the newly selected league

## Solution

Updated the `switchToLeague()` function in LeagueSwitcher to navigate to `/dashboard` after successfully switching leagues.

### Code Change

**File**: `app/components/LeagueSwitcher.vue`

```javascript
const switchToLeague = async (leagueId) => {
  if (leagueId !== currentLeagueId.value) {
    await leaguesStore.switchLeague(leagueId)
  }
  // ✅ Always navigate to dashboard when clicking any league
  navigateTo('/dashboard')
  isOpen.value = false
  emit('league-switched')
}
```

**Key Behavior**: Navigation happens **regardless** of whether you clicked the current league or a different one. This makes the switcher act as a "go to dashboard" button as well.

## User Experience Flow

### Before
1. User is on any page (e.g., `/players`, `/matches`, `/setup`)
2. User opens LeagueSwitcher dropdown
3. User clicks on a different league
4. League switches but user stays on current page
5. ❌ Confusing - they might see "No league selected" or old data

### After
1. User is on any page
2. User opens LeagueSwitcher dropdown
3. User clicks on **any** league (current or different)
4. User is navigated to `/dashboard`
5. ✅ Clear - they see the league's dashboard with current data

**Bonus**: Clicking the current league acts as a quick "go to dashboard" shortcut!

## Technical Details

- Uses Nuxt's `navigateTo()` composable for programmatic navigation
- Navigation only happens when switching to a **different** league
- Clicking the current league closes the dropdown without navigation
- The `@league-switched` event is still emitted for other listeners (e.g., closing mobile menu)

## Edge Cases Handled

- ✅ Clicking current league: No navigation, just closes dropdown
- ✅ Switching leagues: Navigates to dashboard
- ✅ Mobile menu: `@league-switched` event still triggers `closeMobileMenu()`
- ✅ Desktop: Same behavior, consistent UX

## Related Components

- `LeagueSwitcher.vue` - Contains the navigation logic
- `layouts/default.vue` - Uses LeagueSwitcher with `@league-switched` event
- `stores/leagues.js` - `switchLeague()` action handles the data switching

## Impact

- **User Experience**: ✅ Significantly improved - clear feedback when switching leagues
- **Consistency**: ✅ Matches behavior of league switching from other locations (e.g., `/leagues` page)
- **Performance**: No impact - `navigateTo()` is efficient
- **Compatibility**: ✅ Works with existing event handling in layouts
