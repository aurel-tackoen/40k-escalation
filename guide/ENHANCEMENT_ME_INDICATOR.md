# Enhancement: "Me" Indicator in Player Selects

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented  
**Priority**: Medium (UX Improvement)

## Overview

Added a "(me)" indicator next to the current user's player name in all player select dropdowns throughout the application. This helps users quickly identify themselves when selecting players.

## Implementation

### Helper Functions

Added two helper functions in components that use player selects:

```javascript
// For full display (name + faction + me)
const getPlayerDisplayName = (player) => {
  const baseName = `${player.name} (${player.faction})`
  if (currentPlayer.value && player.id === currentPlayer.value.id) {
    return `${baseName} - me`
  }
  return baseName
}

// For filter dropdowns (name only + me)
const getPlayerFilterName = (player) => {
  if (currentPlayer.value && player.id === currentPlayer.value.id) {
    return `${player.name} (me)`
  }
  return player.name
}
```

### Components Updated

#### 1. MatchesView.vue

**Player 1 & Player 2 Selects:**
```vue
<option v-for="player in players" :key="player.id" :value="player.id">
  {{ getPlayerDisplayName(player) }}
</option>
```
- Shows: `John Doe (Space Marines) - me`
- Or: `Jane Smith (Orks)`

**Filter Player Select:**
```vue
<option v-for="player in players" :key="player.id" :value="player.id">
  {{ getPlayerFilterName(player) }}
</option>
```
- Shows: `John Doe (me)`
- Or: `Jane Smith`

#### 2. ArmyListsView.vue

**Player Filter Select:**
```vue
<option v-for="player in players" :key="player.id" :value="player.id">
  {{ getPlayerFilterName(player) }}
</option>
```

**Organizer Player Select:**
```vue
<option v-for="player in players" :key="player.id" :value="player.id">
  {{ getPlayerDisplayName(player) }}
</option>
```

## User Experience

### Before
```
Select Player 1:
- John Doe (Space Marines)
- Jane Smith (Orks)
- Bob Johnson (Necrons)
```

### After
```
Select Player 1:
- John Doe (Space Marines) - me
- Jane Smith (Orks)
- Bob Johnson (Necrons)
```

## Benefits

✅ **Quick Identification** - Users can instantly find themselves in dropdowns  
✅ **Reduced Errors** - Less likely to select wrong player by mistake  
✅ **Better UX** - Familiar pattern from social media apps  
✅ **Accessibility** - Clear visual indicator without requiring color  
✅ **Consistent** - Applied across all player selects in the app

## Technical Details

### Context Detection

The `(me)` indicator appears when:
- User is logged in (has Auth0 session)
- User has a player entity in the current league
- The player in the dropdown matches the user's player entity

### Display Logic

**Full Display (with faction):**
- Format: `Name (Faction) - me`
- Used in: Match player selects, Army player selects

**Compact Display (name only):**
- Format: `Name (me)`
- Used in: Filter dropdowns

### Edge Cases Handled

- ✅ User not logged in: No "(me)" shown
- ✅ User has no player in league: No "(me)" shown
- ✅ Organizer viewing other leagues: Correct "(me)" per league
- ✅ Multiple browser tabs: Uses reactive store state

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `app/components/views/MatchesView.vue` - Added helpers and updated 3 selects
2. ✅ `app/components/views/ArmyListsView.vue` - Added helpers and updated 2 selects
