# Bug Fix: Match Delete API Route Not Found

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Priority**: Critical (Blocking functionality)

## Problem

Match deletion was failing because the API endpoint was returning HTML (the Nuxt app) instead of JSON. The logs showed:
```
API response: <!DOCTYPE html><html>...
```

This meant the API route wasn't being recognized by Nuxt's server.

## Root Cause

The API endpoint file was named `matches.[id].delete.ts` using Nuxt 3's dynamic route parameter syntax with `[id]`. However, this codebase uses a different pattern - **query parameters** instead of route parameters for all DELETE endpoints.

### Pattern Inconsistency

**Other DELETE endpoints in the codebase:**
- `armies.delete.ts` → Uses `?leagueId=X&playerId=Y&round=Z`
- `players.delete.ts` → Uses `?id=X`

**Our endpoint (incorrect):**
- `matches.[id].delete.ts` → Tried to use `/api/matches/:id`

## Solution

### 1. Renamed the File

```bash
# Before
server/api/matches.[id].delete.ts

# After  
server/api/matches.delete.ts
```

### 2. Changed from Route Parameters to Query Parameters

**Before:**
```typescript
// File: server/api/matches.[id].delete.ts
const matchId = parseInt(event.context.params?.id as string)
```

**After:**
```typescript
// File: server/api/matches.delete.ts
const query = getQuery(event)
const matchId = parseInt(query.id as string)
```

### 3. Updated Store Method

**Before:**
```javascript
const response = await $fetch(`/api/matches/${matchId}`, {
  method: 'DELETE'
})
```

**After:**
```javascript
const response = await $fetch(`/api/matches?id=${matchId}`, {
  method: 'DELETE'
})
```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ Renamed `server/api/matches.[id].delete.ts` → `server/api/matches.delete.ts`
2. ✅ Updated `server/api/matches.delete.ts` - Use query parameters
3. ✅ Updated `app/stores/leagues.js` - Use query string in URL

## API Endpoint

**URL**: `DELETE /api/matches?id=<matchId>`

**Example**: `DELETE /api/matches?id=7`

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { /* deleted match object */ },
  "message": "Match deleted successfully"
}
```

## Why This Pattern?

This codebase follows a consistent pattern for DELETE operations:
- Simple query parameter syntax
- Easier to debug
- Consistent with existing endpoints
- No need for dynamic route segments

## Testing

Try deleting a match now. You should see:
1. ✅ Proper JSON response from API
2. ✅ Match removed from the list immediately
3. ✅ Player stats updated
4. ✅ No HTML in console logs

### Expected Console Output

```
Delete match callback called with match: {id: 7, ...}
Page received delete-match event with matchId: 7
Store deleteMatch called with matchId: 7 type: number
Current matches before delete: 3
API response: {success: true, data: {...}, message: "Match deleted successfully"}
Filtering out match with id: 7
Matches after filter: 2 removed: 1
Players refreshed
Match deleted successfully
```

## Code Quality

- ✅ Zero lint errors
- ✅ Consistent with codebase patterns
- ✅ Follows existing DELETE endpoint conventions
- ✅ Proper error handling

## Future Considerations

If we want to use RESTful route parameters (`/api/matches/:id`) in the future:
1. Need to ensure Nuxt dev server recognizes dynamic routes
2. May require server restart after adding dynamic routes
3. Consider standardizing all endpoints to one pattern (query vs route params)
