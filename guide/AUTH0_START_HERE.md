# 🎯 Auth0 Roles - Setup Summary

## The Problem You Had

```
Could not fetch user roles, defaulting to "user": 400 Bad Request
```

This happened because the standard OAuth access token doesn't have permissions to call the Auth0 Management API.

## ✅ The Fix

Changed approach from **Management API** (doesn't work) to **Auth0 Actions** (recommended by Auth0).

## 🚀 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Create Auth0 Action (REQUIRED)

**📖 Follow the complete guide:** `AUTH0_ACTION_REQUIRED.md`

**Quick summary:**
1. Go to Auth0 Dashboard → Actions → Library
2. Click "Build Custom"
3. Name: `Add Roles to Token`
4. Trigger: `Login / Post Login`
5. Copy the code from the guide
6. Click **Deploy**
7. Go to Actions → **Triggers** (or Flows) → Login
8. Drag the Action between Start and Complete
9. Click **Apply**

### Step 2: Create Roles
1. User Management → Roles
2. Create: `admin`, `organizer`, `user`

### Step 3: Assign Roles
1. User Management → Users
2. Select a user → Roles tab
3. Assign Role → Select role → Assign

### Step 4: Test
1. Clear browser cookies
2. Login to your app
3. Check console: Should see `User role from Auth0: admin`
4. Visit `/profile`: Should see colored role badge

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AUTH0_ACTION_REQUIRED.md` | **START HERE** - Complete Action setup guide |
| `AUTH0_ROLES_QUICK_FIX.md` | Summary of changes made |
| `AUTH0_ROLES_SETUP.md` | Detailed Auth0 RBAC documentation |
| `ROLE_DISPLAY_IMPLEMENTATION.md` | UI implementation details |

## 🔍 How It Works Now

```
Login → Auth0 → Execute Action → Add Roles to Token → 
Return to App → Read Custom Claims → Store in Session → 
Display Role Badge
```

## 💡 Key Points

- ✅ No Management API calls needed
- ✅ Roles are in the token automatically
- ✅ Works with standard OAuth flow
- ✅ Recommended by Auth0 documentation
- ✅ No special scopes needed
- ✅ More secure and reliable

## 🎨 Role Badge Colors

- 🔴 **Admin** - Red badge
- 🟣 **Organizer** - Purple badge
- 🔵 **User** - Blue badge (default)

## ⚠️ Important

**Without the Auth0 Action, all users will be "user" by default.**

The Action is REQUIRED for roles to work properly. It takes ~5 minutes to set up.
