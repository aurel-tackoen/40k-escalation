# Painting Progress Feature Implementation

## Overview
The painting progress tracking feature has been successfully integrated into the 40K Escalation League application. Players can now track their miniature painting progress at the unit level, with automatic calculation of overall painted percentages and points.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`db/schema.ts`)
Added `paintingProgress` table with the following fields:
- `id`: Primary key (auto-increment)
- `playerId`: Reference to players table
- `round`: League round number
- `unitName`: Name of the unit (e.g., "Intercessors Squad")
- `totalModels`: Total number of models in the unit
- `paintedModels`: Number of painted models
- `points`: Points value of the unit
- `lastUpdated`: Timestamp of last update
- `createdAt`: Timestamp of creation

### 2. Pinia Store Updates (`app/stores/league.js`)
Added state, getters, and actions for painting progress:

#### New State:
- `paintingProgress`: Array to store painting progress data

#### New Getters:
- `getPaintingStats(playerId, round)`: Calculate painting statistics for a player at a specific round
  - Returns: totalModels, paintedModels, paintedPercentage, paintedPoints, totalPoints, isFullyPainted, units
  
- `paintingLeaderboard`: Get painting leaderboard for current round
  - Sorted by painted percentage (highest to lowest)
  
- `getOverallPaintingStats(playerId)`: Get overall painting progress across all rounds

#### New Actions:
- `fetchPaintingProgress()`: Fetch painting progress from API
- `updatePaintingProgress(progressData)`: Update or create painting progress for a unit
- `deletePaintingProgress(playerId, round, unitName)`: Delete painting progress entry

### 3. API Endpoints

#### GET `/api/painting-progress`
Fetch painting progress data
- Query params: `playerId` (optional), `round` (optional)
- Returns all painting progress, filtered by player/round if provided

#### POST `/api/painting-progress`
Create or update painting progress for a unit
- Body: `{ playerId, round, unitName, totalModels, paintedModels, points }`
- Validates that paintedModels â‰¤ totalModels
- Updates existing entry or creates new one

#### DELETE `/api/painting-progress`
Delete painting progress entry
- Query params: `playerId`, `round`, `unitName` (all required)

### 4. UI Components

#### `PaintingProgress.vue`
Display component showing:
- Summary cards: Models Painted, Completion %, Painted Points
- Color-coded progress bar (red/orange/green/purple based on completion)
- Detailed unit list with individual progress bars
- "Fully Painted" badge when 100% complete
- Edit/Add buttons when in editable mode

Color coding:
- ðŸ”´ Red (0-30%): Low progress
- ðŸŸ¡ Orange (31-70%): Medium progress
- ðŸŸ¢ Green (71-99%): High progress
- ðŸŸ¨ Purple (100%): Fully painted

#### `PaintingProgressModal.vue`
Modal for editing painting progress:
- Add new unit with name, points, total/painted models
- Edit existing unit progress
- Live preview of progress bar
- Validation (painted â‰¤ total models)
- Delete functionality

### 5. Database Migration
Generated migration: `migrations/0003_lumpy_mockingbird.sql`
- Creates `painting_progress` table
- Sets up foreign key relationship to `players` table

## How to Use

### 1. Track Painting Progress
```javascript
// In your component
import { useLeagueStore } from '~/stores/league'

const store = useLeagueStore()

// Add or update unit progress
await store.updatePaintingProgress({
  playerId: 1,
  round: 2,
  unitName: 'Intercessors Squad',
  totalModels: 10,
  paintedModels: 7,
  points: 100
})
```

### 2. Display Progress in UI
```vue
<template>
  <PaintingProgress 
    :stats="paintingStats"
    :editable="true"
    @add-unit="showModal = true"
    @edit-unit="editUnit"
  />
  
  <PaintingProgressModal
    :show="showModal"
    :playerId="playerId"
    :round="currentRound"
    :editingUnit="selectedUnit"
    @save="handleSave"
    @delete="handleDelete"
    @close="showModal = false"
  />
</template>

<script setup>
const store = useLeagueStore()
const paintingStats = computed(() => 
  store.getPaintingStats(playerId, currentRound)
)
</script>
```

### 3. View Painting Leaderboard
```javascript
const leaderboard = computed(() => store.paintingLeaderboard)
// Returns array sorted by painted percentage:
// [
//   { playerId, playerName, faction, paintedPercentage, paintedPoints, ... }
// ]
```

## Next Steps (Recommendations)

### 1. Integration with Army Lists View
- Add PaintingProgress component to `ArmyListsView.vue`
- Show progress for each player's current round army

### 2. Dashboard Integration
- Display painting leaderboard on main dashboard
- Show overall league painting statistics
- Add "Best Painted Army" section

### 3. Bonus Points System (Optional)
- Award league points for painting milestones:
  - +1 point for 50% painted
  - +2 points for 75% painted
  - +5 points for 100% painted
- Update match scoring to include painting bonus

### 4. Apply Database Migration
Run the migration when deployed to production:
```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

### 5. Additional Features to Consider
- Painting deadline reminders
- Weekly/monthly painting challenges
- Historical progress tracking (charts)
- Export painting reports
- "Fastest Painter" award tracking

## Technical Notes

- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key ensures painting progress is deleted if player is removed
- **Validation**: API validates painted models don't exceed total models
- **Performance**: Painting stats are calculated on-demand in getters
- **State Management**: Painting progress cached in store, updated on mutations
- **UI/UX**: Color-coded progress bars provide quick visual feedback

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified:
- `app/stores/league.js` - Added painting progress state/getters/actions
- `db/schema.ts` - Added paintingProgress table definition

### Created:
- `server/api/painting-progress.get.ts` - GET endpoint
- `server/api/painting-progress.post.ts` - POST endpoint
- `server/api/painting-progress.delete.ts` - DELETE endpoint
- `app/components/PaintingProgress.vue` - Display component
- `app/components/PaintingProgressModal.vue` - Edit modal
- `migrations/0003_lumpy_mockingbird.sql` - Database migration
