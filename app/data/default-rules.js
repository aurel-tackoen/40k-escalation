// Game-specific scoring rules
const GAME_SPECIFIC_RULES = {
  victory_points: {
    scoring: (pointsLabel, maxPoints) => `## Scoring System

### ${pointsLabel}
Each match awards ${pointsLabel} based on mission objectives:
- **Primary Objectives:** Main mission goals (typically ${Math.floor(maxPoints * 0.45)}-${Math.floor(maxPoints * 0.5)} ${pointsLabel})
- **Secondary Objectives:** Additional tactical objectives
- **Bonus Objectives:** Additional points as specified by mission

### League Points (LP)
Match results translate to League Points for standings:
- **Win:** 3 League Points
- **Draw:** 1 League Point  
- **Loss:** 0 League Points

> **Tiebreaker:** If players have equal League Points, rankings are determined by total ${pointsLabel} scored across all matches.

---`,

    reporting: (pointsLabel) => `### Results Reporting
- Results must be reported **within 48 hours** of match completion
- Both players should verify the reported scores
- Record ${pointsLabel} scored by each player and the mission played
- Optional: Share photos or battle reports for extra community engagement!

---`,

    standings: (pointsLabel) => `### Ranking System
1. **Primary:** Total League Points (wins/draws)
2. **Tiebreaker 1:** Total ${pointsLabel} scored
3. **Tiebreaker 2:** Head-to-head record

  percentage: {
    scoring: () => `## Scoring System

### Casualty-Based Victory
Matches are won by inflicting casualties on your opponent's army:
- Record the **total army value** for both players at the start
- Record the **total casualty value** inflicted by each player at the end
- Victory is determined by **margin of victory percentage**

### Victory Levels
The margin of victory determines the result:
- **Draw:** Margin < 10%
- **Minor Victory:** Margin 10-24%
- **Major Victory:** Margin 25-49%
- **Massacre:** Margin â‰¥ 50%

**Margin Calculation:**
\`\`\`
Margin = ((Your Casualties Inflicted - Opponent's Casualties Inflicted) / Max Army Value) Ã— 100
\`\`\`

### League Points (LP)
Victory level translates to League Points:
- **Massacre:** 5 League Points
- **Major Victory:** 4 League Points
- **Minor Victory:** 3 League Points
- **Draw:** 1 League Point each
- **Loss:** 0 League Points

> **Tiebreaker:** If players have equal League Points, rankings are determined by total casualties inflicted across all matches.

  },

  scenario: {
    scoring: () => `## Scoring System

### Scenario Objectives

2. **Tiebreaker 1:** If both or neither complete the objective, most casualties inflicted wins
3. **Tiebreaker 2:** If casualties are equal, the match is a draw
